## Cosmological simulations:
- Illustris: `Illustris1_extended_individual_galaxy_values_all1e8Msunh_z0.csv`
- EAGLE: `EAGLE_RefL0100_MstarSFR_allabove1.8e8Msun.txt` (I added this today)
- MUFASA: `MUFASA_GALAXY.txt`
- SCSAM: `SAM_group_catalog_cenANDsat.dat` (but has different timescales on which the SFR is averaged)

## Observations:
- `dickey_NSA_iso_lowmass_gals.txt`
- `tinker_SDSS_centrals_M9.7.dat`

## Zoom simulations:
- `brooks_updated_catalog.dat`
- `cset_Choi16_AGN_z0.0.txt`

I list the zoom simulations as well because it may be nice to find a way to define a distance to the SFMS for them as well. For Alyson's zooms we might want to use Claire's NSA sample for this (because it also goes to lower mass galaxies), and for Ena one of the others. For Ena however her list has only centrals in it and they almost all have no SFR at all which she denotes as 1e-14.

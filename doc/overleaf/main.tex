\section{Introduction}
Generic statement about how galaxy surveys revolutionized the field and allowed
us to study the evolution of galaxy populations. The key things we learned is the
over all decline of star formation in star-forming galaxies and the rapid 
transformation of star-forming galaxies into quiescent galaxies through the 
quenching of star formation. This consequently makes understanding star-forming 
galaxies and more generally the star formation history of galaxies critical in 
galaxy evolution. 

%In fact, observations have long established this so-called \emph{star formation main sequence} (hereafter SFMS) beyond the local universe out to $z > 2$~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][\todo{more}]{noeske2007,salim2007}.  Besides its persistence in observations and simulations, as highlighted earlier, the SFMS describes the star-forming population and hence plays a crucial role in understanding galaxy evolution. A key step then is to robustly and consistently identify the SFMS in data. 

\todo{chang: @tjitske could I assign the following paragraph to you? Yes! I already started playing a bit with the introduction with respect to the simulations section}
Some brief intro about the evolution of simulations. Talk about the difference 
classes of simulations: hydro sims and SAMs. The history of their attempts to 
reproduce the observed galaxy samples and how they incorporate all this nice 
physics to do so. 

This paper is the first in a series studying the star formation and quenching properties of galaxies. The series is initialized by the IQ (Isolated \& Quenched) Collaboratory. This first paper will focus on the rate of star formation in observed and simulated galaxies. Subsequent papers will build mock observational spectra for all simulated galaxies in our sample and compare spectral star formation and quenching indicators (Starkenburg et al. in prep.).

In observations the star forming galaxies are observed to lie on a tight sequence
known as the star formation main sequence. Go through the history of observations.
Measuring and understanding this sequence is important in improving our
understanding of galaxy evolution. There is however not one unified way to fit and describe the SFMS, and depending on both the dataset and the fitting technique used its properties can vary \citep[see e.g.][]{speagle2014}, adding to the complexity of the discussion on its meaning.

Nonetheless, with the key role that starforming galaxies play in our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies, the SFMS is an important relation to compare to for simulations. Moreover, the SFMS can form a tool to understand the starforming and non-starforming galaxy populations and the processes that create those. Therefore we argue that a comparing the galaxy populations in the SFR-$M_{\star}$ plane between different simulations that vary in technique and in descriptions of key physical processes, is important. The SFMS serves as a key feature in galaxy sample data for comparison. Therefore in this paper we compare different simulations by conducting a data-driven comparison centered around the star formation main 
sequences of different data sets. 

In Section~\ref{sec:ourgals}, we describe the simulated and observed galaxies 
used in our analysis.

\section{Our galaxies} \label{sec:ourgals}
In this work, we primarily focus on simulated galaxy samples from four 
large-scale cosmological simulations: three hydrodynamic (Illustris, EAGLE, 
and MUFASA) and one semi-analytic (Santa Cruz SAM). Although we mainly 
focus on the simulated galaxies, for reference, we also include two observed 
galaxy samples: a volume-limited sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 
(hereafter SDSS) and a selected isolated dwarf galaxy sample from the 
NASA-Sloan Atlas (hereafter NSA). We present a brief description of the
four simulations in Section~\ref{sec:galsims}. We also briefly
describe our observed galaxy sample in Section~\ref{sec:obvs}. These 
descriptions will primarily focus on how the SFRs and $M_*$s are derived
for our galaxy samples. 
\todo{revisit once intro is written for fluidity.}

\subsection{Simulated Galaxies} \label{sec:galsims}
\todo{What are the main goals of these simulations -- i.e. what main observables are they trying to reproduce? Also, what are the main ways in which they differ from one another?}
For high-mass galaxies, the AGN-feedback descriptions in the simulations are crucial to get the right stellar--to--halo mass and color distributions. 
For lower mass systems, the stellar feedback is a very important factor for similar reasons. In all cases, the implementation of the sub-grid physics governing these feedback effects are, to a lesser or greater degree constrained by the simulation (by?) matching galaxy properties and(with?) galaxy scaling relations in the present day. Nevertheless, for both feedback prescriptions, there are a number of different (sub-grid) methods in use that will give different results on the number and properties of different galaxy populations in the SFR--$M_{\star}$ plane. 

We compare the population of the SFR--$M_{\star}$ plane between the different large-scale cosmological simulations and the observational datasets. To ensure that we compare similar star formation rate timescales, we use averaged star formation rates over different recent timescales for(from?) all the simulations. Star formation rates derived from $H{\alpha}$ observations correspond to young stars with ages $\lesssim 10\,\mathrm{Myr}$, while star formation rates derived from $UV$ brightness correspond to stars formed in the last $\sim 100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ \citep[e.g.][]{kennicutt2012}. 

Star formation rates for galaxies in our simulations can be defined on 
a range of timescales. For our analysis, however, we use SFRs averaged 
over $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ and instantaneous SFR. \todo{motivate our choice.}
In the hydrodynamic simulations the averaged SFRs are derived using the ages, or formation times, of star particles in the simulated 
galaxies, while instantaneous SFRs are based on 
the rate of star formation in the dense and cold gas. For the semi-analytic simulation the total additional stellar mass formed in a galaxy is outputted every 10 Myr, and the averaged SFRs are computed from that. \todo{what is then the "instataneous" SFR?}
We note that the spatial and temporal resolution of our hydrodynamic 
simulation can significantly impact the averaged SFRs we derive for our 
simulated galaxies. In Appendix~\ref{app:zerosfr}, we discuss how we treat
resolution effects in our analysis. 

Below we give a short description of the Illustris, EAGLE, MUFASA, and 
Santa-Cruz SAM simulations, their key feedback prescriptions, and how 
we derive the instantaneous and $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ aveaged SFRs for 
each simulation.

%For the galaxies in the simulations, we compare star formation rates averaged over the last $10\,\mathrm{Myr}$, $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$, and $1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, as well as the instantaneous SFR. 
%We note that spatial and temporal resolution effects in the simulations  can cause averaged SFRs from stellar ages to under-predict the actual  averaged SFRs in simulations. 
%(most notably the $10\,\mathrm{Myr}$--averaged SFR) can strongly under-predict the actual averaged SFR in the simulations. We therefore add conservative upper limits and uncertainties to these values and study the effect of these on our results.

%Our figures will mostly focus on comparisons of the observationally most relevant timescales (instantaneous, $10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ and $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$) but we will comment on deviations for longer or shorter timescales.


\subsubsection{The Illustris simulation}
The Illustris simulation \citep{Vogelsbergeretal2014, Geneletal2014} evolves a cosmological volume of $(106\ \rm{Mpc})^3$ with a uniform baryonic mass resolution of $1.6\times10^6M_{\sun}$ using the Arepo moving-mesh code. The full halo mass range in the simulation is $2 \times 10^8$--$3\times 10^{14}\ M_{\sun}$, set by resolution (32 particles) at the low-mass end, and by volume (e.g.~including 10 halos with $M>10^{14}M_{\sun}$) at the high-mass end. It employs sub-grid models \citep{Vogelsbergeretal2013} for star-formation \citep{SpringelHernquist2003} and Bondi-like SMBH accretion, a phenomenological model for galactic winds, and two main modes for energy injection from SMBHs. When the accretion occurs at Eddington ratios >0.05, thermal energy is injected continuously in the local environment of the SMBH, while at lower accretion rates, the energy injection occurs in bursts at large distances from the SMBH, generating hot bubbles in the ICM \citep{Sijackietal2007}. The latter mode of feedback is responsible for a steep drop in the cosmic star-formation rate density at late times \citep{Vogelsbergeretal2013}. Previous works discussing aspects of the star-formation main-sequence and/or quenching in the Illustris simulation include \citet{Vogelsbergeretal2014, Sparreetal2015, Blucketal2016, Terrazasetal2017}.

\subsubsection{EAGLE}
The Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environment (EAGLE) project \citep{schaye2015, crain2015} exists of a suite of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations of a standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter universe using a modified version of the N-body/SPH-code Gadget 3 \citep[lastly described in][]{springel2005} called ANARCHY (Dalla Vecchia et al. in prep. see also Appendix A of \citealp{schaye2015} and \citealp{schaller2015}). Modifications include the SPH formulation, the time stepping, and the subgrid physics. The subgrid model for feedback from massive stars and AGN is based on thermal energy injection in the ISM without the need to turn-off cooling or hydrodynamic decoupling of winds \citep{dallavecchia2012}. Similarly to semi-analytical models the subgrid parameters for stellar feedback and BH accretion are calibrated based on present-day galaxy stellar mass function while also requiring reasonable galaxy sizes, and the AGN feedback efficiency is constrained by the amplitude of the central black hole-galaxy mass relation. The galaxy stellar mass range resolved is $10^{8} < M_{\star}/M_{\sun} \lesssim 10^{11}$ and the galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to $\lesssim 0.2$ dex over this full range. The volume used in this project, L0100Ref, is has a baryonic mass resolution of $1.81\times 10^6M_{\sun}$ and a volume of $100$ cMpc on a side. In addition to the Reference version in different size boxes the EAGLE simulations suite also include higher resolution zoomed-in volumes and physics variations. The star formation--stellar mass plane and/or passive fractions in the EAGLE simulations have been previously discussed in \citet{furlong2015, trayford2015, trayford2016, trayford2017}

\subsection{Observed SDSS Galaxies} \label{sec:obvs}
\todo{chang: @claire could you take a look at this section and see if 
there's anything you'd like to add?}
Our main focus in this work is to compare galaxies from our simulation. 
However, since the ultimate goal of the simulations are to reproduce 
observations, we include in our analysis galaxies from the 
SDSS volume-limited sample and the NSA low-luminosity galaxy sample. 
We provide a brief description of the two observed galaxy samples 
below. 

For the SDSS sample, we follow the sample selection of~\cite{tinker2011}. 
We construct the SDSS volume-limited galaxy sample with $M_r - 5\log(h) < -18$ 
and complete in $M_* > 10^{9.4} M_\odot$ from the NYU Value-Added 
Galaxy Catalog \citep[VAGC;][]{blanton2005} which corresponds to 
the SDSS Data Release 7~\citep[DR7;][]{abazajian2009} at redshift 
$z \approx 0.04$. For further details on the sample, we refer readers 
to~\cite{tinker2011,wetzel2013,hahn2017}.

At lower stellar masses, we use galaxies from the NSA catalog. Briefly, 
the NSA catalog is a reprocessing of SDSS DR8, optimized for low-luminosity 
objects. It relies on the improved background subtraction technique of 
\cite{blanton2011}. The catalog extends to $z \approx 0.055$ and includes 
re-calibrated spectroscopy~\citep{yan2011,yan2012} with much
smaller errors. However, this recalibration is mostly relevant only at small 
equivalent width values and hence galaxies on the star formation main 
sequence will be largely unaffected by this.

For both galaxy samples, the stellar masses are estimated using the 
\citet{blanton2007} $\mathtt{kcorrect}$ code, which assumes a 
\citep{chabrier2003} IMF. The SFRs are derived from the SSFRs of the 
current release of~\citet{brinchmann2004}\footnote{http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/}. 
In~\citet{brinchmann2004}, SSFRs 
$\gtrsim 10^{-11} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ are  derived from $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ 
emissions, $10^{-11}\gtrsim$ SSFRs $\gtrsim 10^{-12} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ 
are derived from a combination of emission lines, and SSFRs 
$\lesssim 10^{-12} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ are mainly based on $D_n4000$. 
We emphasize that SSFRs $\lesssim 10^{-12} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ should only be 
considered upper limits to the true value \citep{salim2007}.

\subsection{Identifying Isolated/Central Galaxies}
Galaxies and their detailed properties carry the 
imprint of their environment (~\citealt{hubble1936, oemler1974, dressler1980, guzzo1997}, 
for a recent review see~\citealp{blanton2009}). The environment
dependence of, for instance, the dependence of the quiescent 
fraction~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][\todo{more citations}]{peng2010,hahn2015}
and the timescale of star formation quenching~\citep{wetzel2013,hahn2017a}, 
suggest that different physical mechanisms act in different environments 
to impact galaxy star formation. Furthermore,~\cite{wang2018} recently 
found significant discrepancies between the SFMSs of central versus 
satellite galaxies. Without delving further into the environment dependence,  
\emph{we focus solely on the central galaxies}, which constitute the majority
of massive galaxies ($M_* > 10^{9.5}M_\odot$) at $z \sim 0$. 

Despite its long recognized importance, galaxy environment is often 
heterogeneously defined in the literature~\citep[see][]{campbell2015}. 
In our simulation, centrals are similarly classified 
inconsistently \todo{(something about how the halos are different and 
that propagates to central classifications. maybe a sentence on what they do?)} 
Furthermore, in these classifications the underlying dark matter 
information is used for the classification. Such classifications 
cannot be reproduced on observed galaxy samples and thus complicate 
comparison to observations. Therefore, we identify central galaxies in all of our simulations 
consistently using an extended version of the~\cite{tinker2011} group 
finder, designed to identify satellite/centrals in observations. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \todo{paragraph describing Jeremy's new group finder code} 
\end{itemize}
\emph{Galaxies with $P_\mathrm{sat} < 0.01$ are designated as centrals.} 

Overall, we find good agreement between the central classifications of 
the group finder and simulations. Using purity and completeness as defined 
in Eqs.~13 and~15 of~\cite{campbell2015}, we find purities of 
$99\%, 93\%, 84\%$, and $90\%$ and completenesses of $86\%$, $89\%$, 
$91\%$, and $86\%$  for the Illustris, EAGLE, MUFASA and Santa Cruz SAM 
simulations respectively. For the hydrodynamic simulations, we find no 
significant stellar mass dependence in the purities. However, the Santa 
Cruz SAM has purity of $44\%$ at $M_*$ below $10^{8.5}M_\odot$ and $97\%$ 
above. Consequently, we impose a stellar mass limit of $M_* > 10^{8.5} M_\odot$
for the Santa Cruz SAM. In addition to the overall agreement in central 
classifications, we confirm that the group finder classification does \emph{not} 
impact the results of this paper. In the next section, we proceed to fitting 
the star formation main sequence of simulated galaxies identified as centrals.

%To define isolated galaxies we employ different methods to the volume limited datasets and the large cosmological simulations, and to the SDSS-NSA dataset and the zoom simulations. In all cases the simulated galaxies are treated in a similar sense as the observed galaxies, and a probability of being a satellite is derived for all galaxies.

\section{Fitting the Star Formation Main Sequence}\label{sec:sfmsfit}
We present the SFR--$M_*$ relation of central galaxies identified 
from the simulations and observations of Section~\ref{ourgals} in 
Figure~\ref{fig:sfrmstar}. Regardless of SFR timescale (top/bottom),
for both simulations and observations, and over four orders of magnitude 
in stellar mass, \emph{the SFR and $M_*$ of star-forming galaxies lie 
tightly correlated on the SFMS}. A well-defined SFMS can be found in 
each panel of Figure~\ref{fig:sfrmstar}.

Despite its universality among multiple observations and simulations, 
different datasets give rise to significantly SFR--$M_*$ distributions.
This makes the SFMS difficult to \emph{consistently} quantify. So far 
in the literature, a wide variety 
of fitting methods have been applied to data. For instance, \cite{bluck2016} 
fit the SFMS using median $\log\mathrm{SFR}$s of galaxies with 
$M_* < 10^{10}M_\odot$ and extrapolate to higher masses. This method, however, 
assumes that all $M_* < 10^{10}M_\odot$ galaxies lie on the SFMS and that 
there is no variation in the slope of the SFMS at higher stellar masses. 
Alternatively, \cite{lee2015} fit the SFMS using median 
$\log\,\mathrm{SFR}$s of galaxies in the sample after some color-color cut 
to identify SF galaxies. Other recent works in the literature have opted 
for more sophisticated methods such as fitting a three-component
Gaussian~\citep{bisigello2018} or a zero-inflated negative binomial 
distribution~\citep{feldmann2017}. 

All of these methods require arbitrary assumptions or hard cuts on the 
sample. Moreover, these methods struggle with fitting the SFMS over a 
wide SFR or $M_*$ range and for the wide variety of SSFR distributions we see 
in simulations and observations. Even for fixed a stellar mass bin 
($10.4 < \log M_* < 10.6$), Figure~\ref{fig:pssfr} reveals the 
significant discrepancies in the SSFR distributions of our four simulations. 
Therefore, in an effort to better fit a wide variety of star formation--stellar
mass distributions and to relax the assumptions and cuts imposed on the data, 
\emph{we present a flexible and data-driven method for fitting the SFMS that 
makes use of Gaussian Mixture density estimation}~\citep[][]{Press:1992:NRC:148286, 9780471006268}. 

\subsection{Using Gaussian Mixture Models}
\todo{some intro on the philosophy behind gmm} 
Besides its comprehensive use in machine learning and statistics, Gaussian 
Mixture Density Estimation has also been used in wide range of astronomical 
analyses~\citep{hogg2010,bovy2011,lee2012,taylor2015}.

Gaussian Mixture Density Estimation uses a Gaussian Mixture Model 
(hereafter GMM), a weighted sum of $k$ Gaussian component densities 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gmm}
\hat{p}(x;\bm{\theta}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k} \pi_i \, \mathcal{N}(x; \bm{\theta}_i),
\end{equation}
to estimate the density. The weights, $\pi_i$, mean, and variance  
$\bm{\theta}_i=\{\mu_i, \sigma_i\}$ 
of the components are free parameters in the GMM. For a given data set 
$\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$, these parameters are most commonly estimated through
the expectation-maximization algorithm~\citep[EM;]{dempster1977,neal1998}. 

Starting with randomly assigned $\bm{\theta}_{i}^0$ to the $k$ GMM components, 
the EM algorithm iterates between two steps. First, for every data point, 
$x_i$, the algorithm computes for a probability of $x_i$ being generated by 
each GMM component. These probabilities act as assignment weights to each of
the components. Next, based on these weights, $\bm{\theta}_i^t$ of the components 
are updated to $\bm{\theta}_i^{t+1}$ to maximize the likelihood of the assigned 
data. $\pi_i$ are also updated by summing up the assignment weights and 
normalizing the sum by the total number of data points. These steps are 
repeated until convergence --- \emph{i.e.} when $p(\{x_1, ..., x_n\} ; \bm{\theta}_t)$ 
converges. Instead of starting with randomly assigning $\bm{\theta}_{i}^0$, 
we initiate our EM algorithm using a $k$-means clustering algorithm~\citep{lloyd1982}.
More specifically, for our Gaussian mixture density estimation we use 
the $k$-$\mathtt{means}$++ algorithm of~\cite{arthur2007}. 

For our actual SFMS fitting method, we first divide the galaxy 
sample into stellar mass bins of width $\Delta \log\,M∗$. In 
this paper we use bins of $\Delta \log\,M∗ = 0.2\  \mathrm{dex}$; however, 
this choice does not significantly impact the final fit. For each stellar 
mass bin, if there are more than $N_\mathrm{thresh}=100$ galaxies in the bin, 
we fit the SSFR distribution using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) 
with 1 to 3 components with parameters determined from the EM algorithm 
described above. Our restriction to models with a maximum of 3 components 
is motivated by the three main galaxy classifications: quiescent, 
star-forming, and transitioning populations. Furthermore, for our observed 
galaxy samples, even when we allow for more than 3 components, 
the best-fit GMMs have $k\leq3$. We confirm that restricting ourselves 
to 3 components does not significantly impact the results of this work
(Appendix~\ref{app:gmm}). 

Out of the three ($k\leq3$) GMMs, we select the ``best-fit'' model with the lowest Bayesian Information 
Criteria~\citep[BIC;][]{schwarz1978}. BIC is often used in conjunction with 
GMMs~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{leroux1992,roeder1997,fraley1998,steele2010performance} 
and also more generally for model selection in 
astronomy~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{liddle2007,broderick2011,vakili2016}.
In addition to the likelihood, BIC introduces a penalty term for the number
of parameters in the model. This way, using BIC not only finds a good fit to 
the data, but it also addresses the concern of over-fitting. 
% CHH: not sure if we want to include this figure}.
% In Figure~\ref{fig:gmm_pedagog},  

In the best-fit GMM, we designate the Gaussian component of the 
best-fit GMM with mean $\log\,\mathrm{SSFR} > −11$ as the SFMS component.
In the case when more than one GMM component has mean 
$\log\,\mathrm{SSFR} > −11$, the component with the larger weight 
(\emph{i.e.} the mode) is designated as the SFMS component. Typically in such a 
situation, the SFRs of the SFMS is not well described by a log-normal
distribution. In observations, we do not encounter this situation. 
In simulations, however, we encounter this situation in lower stellar mass bins 
($\log\,M_* < 10^{9}\ M_\odot$) of the Illustris and EAGLE simulations. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:fitdemo}, we illustrate our GMM SFMS fitting for the 
central galaxies of the Illustris simulation in two stellar mass 
ranges highlighted in the left panel: $10.4 < \log\,M_* < 10.6$ (center) 
and $11.0 < \log\,M_* < 11.2$ (right). For the two stellar mass bins, 
we compare the SSFR distributions of the bins to the components of the 
best-fit GMMs derived from our SFMS fitting method. The SFMS component 
is plotted in blue. The SSFR distribution of the center panel is best 
described by a GMM with three components while the SSFR distribution 
in the right  panel is best described by a GMM with only two components.
%The right panels illustrate the wide variation in SSFR distributions of the galaxy samples. 
These comparisons highlights the flexibility and effectiveness 
of our fitting method in identifying the SFMS for different SSFR 
distributions. All the code used for our SFMS fitting is publicly available 
at \url{https://github.com/changhoonhahn/LetsTalkAboutQuench}.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
\subsection{SFMS of simulated galaxies}
Now with our method for fitting the SFMS, which can be flexibly 
applied a wide range of SSFR distributions, we identify the SFMSs of our simulated
central galaxies from Section~\ref{sec:ourgals}. For the two SFR timescales,
instantaneous and $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$, we present the best-fit SFMSs of our 
simulated galaxies from the Illustris, EAGLE, MUFASA, and Santa Cruz SAM 
simulations in Figures~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_inst} and~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_100myr}, 
respectively. %For reference we include the best-fit SFMS of the SDSS central galaxies in the top right panel. 
The best-fit SFMSs of the Illustris, EAGLE, and Santa Cruz SAM simulations
exhibit a similar monotonic relation between SFR and $M_*$ out to 
$M_* \gtrsim 10^{11}M_\odot$, for both SFR timescales. The best-fit SFMSs 
for MUFASA, however, turn over at 
$M_* \sim 10^{10.5} M_\odot$ and decreases in SFR at high stellar masses. 
We confirm that this turnover is \emph{not} caused by misidentification of 
the SFMS or some systematic effect of the fitting by examining the 
best-fit GMM components  and the $p(\log\mathrm{SSFR})$ in these higher 
stellar mass bins. When we compare the best-fit SFMSs of the simulations 
altogether in more detail, we find \emph{order of magnitude discrepancies 
in SFR among the best-fits throughout the stellar mass range of the 
simulations for both SFR timescales} (bottom right panels of 
Figures~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_inst} and~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_100myr}). 
%These best-fit SFMSs allow us to make detailed comparison among the simulations. 

The uncertainties for the best-fit SFMSs in Figures~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_inst} and~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_100myr} 
are derived from bootstrap resampling~\citep{efron1979} in each stellar mass 
bin of the fitting. These uncertainties are \emph{underestimates} because 
they do not account for ``cosmic variance'' --- \emph{i.e.} we only have one 
finite volume realization of each simulation. Uncertainty of the best-fit 
SFMS corresponds to the uncertainty of the means of the SFMS GMM component, 
which is only one of the parameters in the GMM. Uncertainties from bootstrap 
resampling, however, do \emph{not} account for the correlations between the 
mean of the SFMS GMM and other
parameters of the GMM (Eq.~\ref{eq:gmm}). A more robust estimate of the 
uncertainties would involve estimating the marginalized posterior distribution 
of the SFMS GMM component mean using a method like MCMC. Since this still 
does not account for cosmic variance, we use bootstrap uncertainties. 

From the best-fit SFMSs, we can further 
parameterize the SFMS to some functional form as often done in the 
literature --- \emph{e.g.} power-law~\citep{speagle2014} or broken 
power-law~\citep{lee2015}. With little evidence of a turnover in the 
SFMS for most of our galaxies, we fit a power-law of the form 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:powerlaw}
\log\,\mathrm{SFR}_\mathrm{MS} = m\,(\log\,M_* - 10.5) + b
\end{equation}
to the SFMSs in Figure~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_powerlaw}. We list the best-fit 
(maximum likelihood) parameter values of Eq.~\ref{eq:powerlaw} in 
Table~\ref{tab:sfms_powerlaw}. The power-law parameterizations accentuate 
the stellar mass dependence of the SFMSs and can reveal the mass dependence 
in the discrepancies 
among the SFMSs. Putting aside MUFASA, which has a significant turnover at high 
stellar masses, we find significant discrepancies in the slopes of the SFMSs
of the simulations with Santa Cruz SAM having the steepest SFMS and EAGLE 
having the shallowest SFMS. The power-law SFMS fits, however, reveal little 
mass dependence in the discrepancies of the SFMSs. For instantaneous SFR, 
the discrepancies between the SFMSs of Illustris, EAGLE, and Santa Cruz SAM are 
$\sim 0.5\,\mathrm{dex}$ throughout the stellar mass range. Meanwhile, 
for $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ SFR, we find slightly
greater discrepancies among Illustris, EAGLE, and Santa Cruz SAM throughout
the stellar mass range.

%At lower stellar masses (), for both instantaneous SFRs and $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ SFRs, the SFMS disagree with each  other by more than an order of magnitude. \todo{talk about how MUFASA for 100 Myr is an outlier because of the high  stellar mass limit and the high mass turnover.}

One factor that impacts our SFMS fits is the strict lower limit of the 
$\log\mathrm{SFR}$s caused by the resolution effects in the simulations. 
This is particularly evident in the $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ SFR--$M_*$ 
relations of the hydrodynamical simulations of Figure~\ref{fig:sfrmstar}---especially 
MUFASA. As we describe in Section~\ref{sec:galsims}, the $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ SFRs are 
calculated using \todo{chh: fill appropriate detail}. For a galaxy to 
have star formation (\emph{i.e.} SFR $> 0$), it must \emph{at least} 
form one star particle over $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$. A single star particle 
forming over $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ amounts to a SFR of 
$\sim 0.02\ M_{\sun}\ yr^{-1}$ for Illustris and EAGLE and
$\sim 0.2\ M_{\sun}\ yr^{-1}$ for MUFASA. This resolution limit, ultimately 
impacts the SFMS fits at stellar masses below $10^{8.4}$, $10^{8.6}$, and 
$10^{9.4}M_\odot$ for Illustris, EAGLE, and MUFASA respectively. 
These stellar mass limits have accordingly been imposed on the SFMS fits
and power-law SFMS fits in Figures~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_100myr} 
and~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_powerlaw}. In Appendix~\ref{app:zerosfr}, we describe
how we derive these stellar mass limits.

\subsection{Beyond the SFMS of simulated galaxies}
So far, we have focused solely on the position of the SFMSs for our simulated
galaxies---\emph{i.e.} $\mu_\mathrm{SFMS}$. Our GMM fitting method 
(Section~\ref{sec:sfmsfit}), however, also determines parameters besides
$\mu_\mathrm{SFMS}$ such as the width of the SFMS component, $\sigma_\mathrm{SFMS}$, 
and $\bm{\theta}_i$ of other components. Using the derived $\sigma_\mathrm{SFMS}$, 
we can compare the width of the SFMS among the simluations 
(Figure~\ref{fig:sfms_width}). The uncertainties for the widths are 
calculated through bootstrap resampling in the same way as the 
uncertainties for the SFMS fits. Overall, we find little stellar mass 
dependence in $\sigma_\mathrm{SFMS}$ for the simulations. For Illustris, 
EAGLE, MUFASA, and Santa Cruz SAM we respectively find 
$\sigma_\mathrm{SFMS} \sim 0.16, 0.20, 0.21$, and $0.20\,\mathrm{dex}$ 
for instantaneous SFR and
$\sigma_\mathrm{SFMS} \sim 0.17, 0.24, 0.23$, and $0.24\,\mathrm{dex}$
for $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ SFR. These $\sigma_\mathrm{SFMS}$ are narrower 
than the ${\sim}0.3\,\mathrm{dex}$ width measured in 
observations~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{daddi2007, noeske2007, magdis12, whittaker12}. 
This difference, however, does not account for the uncertainties in the 
observed SFR measurements, which would reduce the discrepancy. We 
therefore conclude that \emph{the width of the SFMS from our 
simulations are in agreement with the observed SFMS width.}

The GMM components other than the SFMS component, also offer interesting
insights into the other galaxy populations. When we examine the mean and 
variance of all the components from our fitting for our simulated galaxies 
we find correspondence between the components and the quiescent, 
transitioning, and star-burst galaxy populations (Figure~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_comps}).
Similar to how we designated the SFMS component of the GMM, we 
designate the component with the lowest SFR as the quiescent 
component, the component with SFR in between the SFMS and the quiescent 
components as transitioning, and the component with SFR higher than the 
SFMS component as the star-burst component. In Figure~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_comps}, 
we mark the SFMS components in blue, quiescent components in orange, and 
the other components in green. 

All of the simulations have significant populations below the SFMS at all 
masses. The hydrodynamical simulations have relatively tight quiescent components 
$\sim 1\,\mathrm{dex}$ below the SFMS. The quiescent components of the 
Santa Cruz SAM, meanwhile, are much broader and extend below 
$\log\,\mathrm{SFR} = -4$. Regardless of their position and width, the 
significant quiescent populations at low stellar masses are in disagreement
with observations~\citep{geha2012}, which find no isolated/central quenched 
galaxies below $M_* \sim 10^9 M_\odot$. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \todo{what's causing central galaxies to be quenched below 
        $10^9M_\odot$}
\end{itemize}
This discrepancy between simulations and observations, however, must be 
taken with a grain of salt. Both the environment and quenched classifications 
in \cite{geha2012} are defined differently than in the simulations. 
\cite{geha2012} classifies as a galaxy as quenched if it
does not have an $H\alpha$ emission and based on a $D_n 4000$ criteria. 
Furthermore, \todo{the isolation criteria of \cite{geha2012} is more 
stringent than the group finder. [chang: @claire is this true?]} 
%incept the idea for paper2. 

%Figure~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_comps} reveals components besides the SFMS and quiescent components. For instance, 
In Illustris and the Santa Cruz SAM, our GMM fitting
finds a number of components between the SFMS and quiescent components ---
\emph{i.e.} transitioning galaxies. For Illustris, transitioning components 
are identified at $10^9 M_\odot < M_* < 10^{11}M_\odot$. For the Santa Cruz SAM, 
transitioning components are identified at $M_* > 10^{10} M_\odot$. We also 
identify components with SFRs above the SFMS. These \emph{star-burst} 
components are particularly evident in the Santa Cruz SAM, where a significant
star-burst population is observed at $10^9 M_\odot < M_* < 10^{10} M_\odot$. 
Besides the Santa Cruz SAM, we also find star-burst components at the lowest
stellar masses ($M_* < 10^9 M_\odot$) of the Illustris and EAGLE simulations 
for $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ SFRs. 

The different components we identify using the GMM fitting allows us to make a 
number of interesting comparisons of the simulated galaxies. Overall
the galaxies from hydrodynamical simulations have similar components
and features in the SFR--$M_*$ data space. Besides the difference in the 
position and width of the SFMS, 
the only significant discrepancy is the transitioning components of
Illustris. The transitioning components in the Illustris galaxies, however, 
help explain the tighter width of the SFMS compared to the other hydrodynamical 
simulations in Figure~\ref{fig:sfms_width}. A more significant difference 
revealed by the non-SFMS components is the discrepancy between the hydrodynamical 
simulations and the SAM. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \todo{Why is the SAM so different overall?}
    \item[-] Why \todo{Why does Santa Cruz SAM have a broader SFR?} 
    \item[-] Why \todo{Why does Santa Cruz SAM have star-bursts in "intermediate" stellar masses}
\end{itemize}

Another set of parameters we infer from our GMM fitting is the weight of the 
GMM components ($\pi_i$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:gmm}). Since each of the components 
correspond to a galaxy population, these weights correspond to the fractional
contribution of the different populations. For example, the fractional 
contribution of the quenched component is an estimate of the quiescent 
fraction~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{blanton2009, geha2012,hahn2015}. We present 
the fractional contribution of all the components from our GMM fitting as a
function of stellar mass in Figure~\ref{fig:kandinsky}: SFMS (blue), 
quenched (orange), $\mathrm{SFR}=0$ galaxies (red), intermediate (green), 
and star-burst (purple). We present the uncertainties of $\pi_i$, estimated
through bootstrap resampling, in Figure~\ref{fig:fcomp_uncertainty} of 
Appendix~\ref{app:zerosfr}. 
For every simulation, a significant fraction of galaxies have SFR$=0$. 
In hydrodynamical simulations, galaxies with SFR below the resolution 
limit have $\mathrm{SFR}{=}0$ (Appendix~\ref{app:zerosfr}). They therefore
can be considered quiescent galaxies. In the Santa Cruz SAM, 
\todo{chang: @tjistke why do we have a significant fraction 
of galaxies with SFR$=0$ in the SAM? Can they be thought of as quiescent?} 

The fractional contributions of the GMM components in Figure~\ref{fig:kandinsky}
reveal disagreements between trends established from 
observations and our simulated galaxies --- especially the ones from 
hydrodynamical simulations. As we mentioned earlier, observations 
established a stellar mass lower bound for isolated/central quenched
galaxies~\citep{geha2012}. From Figure~\ref{fig:kandinsky}, we find significant quiescent
populations at $M_* < 10^9 M_\odot$, confirming 
Figure~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_comps}. Treating SFR$=0$ galaxies as quiescent, the quiescent 
fraction for the EAGLE simulation is roughly $0.4$ at $10^9M_\odot$. 
Illustris with $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ SFRs and MUFASA with instantaneous SFRs
have similarly high quiescent fractions. Even in the Santa Cruz SAM, we 
find a non-negligible ($\sim 10\%$) quiescent fraction at $10^9M_\odot$. 

At $M_* > 10^9M_\odot$, we find little stellar mass dependence in the 
fraction of high SFR components (SFMS and star-burst; blue and purple 
in Figure~\ref{fig:kandinsky}) in our hydrodynamical simulations at 
$M_* < 10^{11}M_\odot$. If we take the quiescent fraction to be 
$f_\mathrm{Q} = 1 - \sum\limits_{\mathrm{high\,SFR}} \pi_i$, then the 
quiescent fraction of our central galaxies from hydrodynamical simulations 
have little stellar mass dependence at $10^9 < M_* < 10^{11} M_\odot$ ---
unlike $f_\mathrm{Q}$s from~\cite{baldry2006,peng2010,hahn2015},
which all find significant stellar mass dependence in the quiescent/red fraction of 
isolated galaxies in SDSS. In this regards, the quiescent fraction of the 
Santa Cruz SAM is in good agreement with the isolated galaxy 
quiescent fraction from SDSS~\citep{baldry2006,peng2010,hahn2015}.

\todo{highlight how the data-driven fitting method provides detailed insights into 
simulated galaxies besides the ones that lie on the SFMSs .
We ultimately conclude from these insights that the hydro sims do not agree
well with trends established from observations. Santa Cruz SAM does better.}

\subsection{Comparing to Observations}
Our data-driven GMM SFMS fitting provides a principled way to compare 
galaxy populations through the major features in the data-space. These 
comparisons have so far revealed a number of agreements and discrepancies
among the central galaxies in our simulations. The ultimate goal of 
these simulations, however, is to reproduce the observations, which means
that we ultimately want to compare them to observations. In this section, 
we extend our GMM SFMS fitting to our observed galaxy sample from SDSS and NSA
and compare our simulated galaxies to observations.


First, we compare the SFMS of our simulated galaxies to the best-fit SFMS
of our SDSS and NSA central galaxies
(Figure~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_inst} and~\ref{fig:sfmsfit_100myr}). 
we find that the simulations have a steeper SFMS than our observations

Looking beyond the SFMS, 
The SDSS samples show a SFR-$M_*$ relation that is best fitted by \emph{one} Gaussian at lower masses, unlike any of the simulations. This is noteworthy even though the low-mass sample is far from volume-complete and especially many low-SFR galaxies may be missed at lower masses.
%\item[-] The observations show a very well defined, and for higher mass bins quite narrow, low-SFR population, with a small intermediate third population for only three mass bins. The low-SFR population is more narrow and generally with the mean at slightly lower SFR than for all three hydro simulations. It is located in between the intermediate and low-SFR populations of the SAM.

The comparison between our simulations and observations have been pretty 
qualitative. We deliberately refrain from a more detailed comparison due 
to the limitations of such a comparison. The SFRs and $M_*$, the main 
galaxy properties considered in this paper, are defined and measured 
differently in simulations versus observations. SFRs from the SDSS and 
NSA catalogs are measured using a combination of $H\alpha$ and $D_n 4000$. 
Although we choose the SFR timescales to best reflect observed SFRs, 
\todo{TKS: Compare to Speagle2014 combined dataset fits and discuss with respect to the large discrepancy they note in MS-slopes for the SDSS sample of $~0.4$ dex. This is partly due to using different SFR indicators (nice segue to the 2nd and 3rd papers), but not completely}
we're still comparing apples to oranges. 
In the next paper we will bring this comparison on a more equal footing 
by deriving star formation rates from mock observations of the simulated 
galaxies (Starkenburg et al. in prep.).

%comparison to observations are complicated by a number of factors.  First the SFRs and stellar masses of observations are defined by kcorrect  and emission lines and dn4000. While our SFR timescales were chosen to best  reflect the observed SFR, it's still not an apples to apples comparison.  Second, the stellar mass and SFRs of observed galaxies have uncertainties  associated to them. If unaccounted for, these uncertainties will impact the  components recovered from the GMM fitting and ultimately the SFMS fits. 
%All of the points in this subsection are severely affected by the different ways that SFR (and $M_*$) are measured in the observations and the simulations.

\section{Gaussian Mixture Models: 1D and Beyond} \label{app:gmm}
So far we have assumed that one, two, or three populations would describe galaxies in the SFR--$M_*$ plane well. We have checked whether the possibility of adding more than three Gaussians in the GMM shows that more populations are present. This is the case only for the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model, where in a number of bins the presence of 4, 5, or (in one case) 6 Gaussians is preferred. In almost all cases the added Gaussians have low weight and form effectively additional intermediate populations. For both Illustris and EAGLE there is only one mass bin where a fourth population would be preferred. For all other mass bins in all the hydrodynamical simulations, and all mass bins in the SDSS 3 or less Gaussians are preferred.


In addition to identifying the SFMS, the GMM fitting method described above can 
be extended to describe the entire SFR-$M_*$ relation using a two-dimensional 
GMM. In Figure~\ref{fig:2dgmm}, we compare the instantaneous SFR to $M_*$ relation 
of central galaxies in the EAGLE simulation with the best-fit two-dimensional GMM. 
The over-plotted shaded ellipses represent the two-dimensional Gaussian components
of the best-fit GMM. Overall the best-fit 2D GMM captures the features in the 
EAGLE SFR-$M_*$ relation. It also provides a straightforward way of comparing 
different SFR-$M_*$ relations. However, as Figure~\ref{fig:2dgmm} illustrates, 
specifically identifying the SFMS using the two-dimensional model is more 
challenging. Therefore in this paper, we do not discuss the 2D GMM further.

  abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) started a new phase in 2008 August, 
with new instrumentation and new surveys focused on Galactic structure
and chemical evolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature
in the clustering of galaxies and the quasar Ly$\alpha$ forest, and a
radial velocity search for planets around \textasciitilde{}8000 stars. This paper
describes the first data release of SDSS-III (and the eighth counting
from the beginning of the SDSS). The release includes five-band imaging
of roughly 5200 deg2 in the southern Galactic cap, bringing
the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg2, or
over a third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been
reprocessed with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final,
self-consistent photometric recalibration and flat-field determination.
This release also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan
Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE-2),
consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high
and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million stellar
spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed
through an improved stellar parameter pipeline, which has better
determination of metallicity for high-metallicity stars.},

  abstract = {We investigate models of self-consistent chemical enrichment of the 
intergalactic medium (IGM) from z = 6.0 -$>$ 1.5, based on hydrodynamic
simulations of structure formation that explicitly incorporate outflows
from star-forming galaxies. Our main result is that outflow
parametrizations derived from observations of local starburst galaxies,
in particular momentum-driven wind scenarios, provide the best agreement
with observations of CIV absorption at z \textasciitilde{} 2-5. Such models sufficiently
enrich the high-z IGM to produce a global mass density of CIV absorbers
that is relatively invariant from z = 5.5 -$>$ 1.5, in agreement with
observations. This occurs despite continual IGM enrichment causing an
increase in volume-averaged metallicity by \textasciitilde{} \texttimes{} 5-10 over this
redshift range, because energy input accompanying the enriching outflows
causes a drop in the global ionization fraction of CIV. Comparisons to
observed CIV column density and linewidth distributions and CIV-based
pixel optical depth ratios provide significant constraints on wind
models. Our best-fitting outflow models show mean IGM temperatures only
slightly above our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few
per cent with volume-weighted metallicities around 10-3 at z
\textasciitilde{} 3, significant amounts of collisionally ionized CIV absorption and a
metallicity-density relationship that rises rapidly at low overdensities
and flattens at higher ones. In general, we find that outflow speeds
must be high enough to enrich the low-density IGM at early times but low
enough not to overheat it, and concurrently must significantly suppress
early star formation while still producing enough early metals. It is
therefore non-trivial that locally calibrated momentum-driven wind
scenarios naturally yield the desired strength and evolution of
outflows, and suggest that such models represent a significant step
towards understanding the impact of galactic outflows on galaxies and
the IGM across cosmic time.},

  abstract = {The red sequence is an important feature of galaxy clusters and plays a 
crucial role in optical cluster detection. Measurement of the slope and
scatter of the red sequence are affected both by selection of red
sequence galaxies and measurement errors. In this paper, we describe a
new error-corrected Gaussian Mixture Model for red sequence galaxy
identification. Using this technique, we can remove the effects of
measurement error and extract unbiased information about the intrinsic
properties of the red sequence. We use this method to select red
sequence galaxies in each of the 13,823 clusters in the maxBCG catalog,
and measure the red sequence ridgeline location and scatter of each.
These measurements provide precise constraints on the variation of the
average red galaxy populations in the observed frame with redshift. We
find that the scatter of the red sequence ridgeline increases mildly
with redshift, and that the slope decreases with redshift. We also
observe that the slope does not strongly depend on cluster richness.
Using similar methods, we show that this behavior is mirrored in a
spectroscopic sample of field galaxies, further emphasizing that
ridgeline properties are independent of environment. These precise
measurements serve as an important observational check on simulations
and mock galaxy catalogs. The observed trends in the slope and scatter
of the red sequence ridgeline with redshift are clues to possible
intrinsic evolution of the cluster red sequence itself. Most
importantly, the methods presented in this work lay the groundwork for
further improvements in optically based cluster cosmology.},

  shorttitle = {The {{zCOSMOS}} Redshift Survey},
  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/200912558},
  abstract = {Context. Groups of galaxies are a common environment, bridging the gap 
between starforming field galaxies and quiescent cluster galaxies.
Within groups secular processes could be at play, contributing to the
observed strong decrease of star formation with cosmic time in the
global galaxy population. Aims: We took advantage of the wealth
of information provided by the first 10 000 galaxies of the
zCOSMOS-bright survey and its group catalogue to study in detail the
complex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties. Methods: The classical indicator Fblue, i.e., the fraction
of blue galaxies, proved to be a simple but powerful diagnostic tool. We
studied its variation for different luminosity and mass selected galaxy
samples, divided as to define groups/field/isolated galaxy subsamples.
 Results: Using rest-frame evolving B-band volume-limited samples,
the groups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift
increases, but maintains a systematic difference (a lower
Fblue) with respect to the global galaxy population, and an
even larger difference with respect to the isolated galaxy population.
However moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparent that such
differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the B-band
luminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass,
bright blue galaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass,
counterparts. By carefully focusing the analysis on narrow mass bins
such that mass segregation becomes negligible we find that only for the
lowest mass bin explored, i.e., log (\{$\backslash$cal M\}*/\{$\backslash$cal
M\}$\odot$) $\leq$ 10.6 , does a significant residual difference
in color remain as a function of environment, while this difference
becomes negligible toward higher masses. Conclusions: Our results
indicate that red galaxies of mass log (\{$\backslash$cal M\}*/\{$\backslash$cal
M\}$\odot$) $\geq$ 10.8 are already in place at z 1 and do not
exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possibly originating from
so-called nature or internal mechanisms. In contrast, for lower galaxy
masses and redshifts lower than z 1, we observe the emergence in
groups of a population of nurture red galaxies: slightly deviating from
the trend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy
population, and more so with cosmic time. These galaxies exhibit
signatures of group-related secular physical mechanisms directly
influencing galaxy evolution. Our analysis implies that these mechanisms
begin to significantly influence galaxy evolution after z 1, a
redshift corresponding to the emergence of structures in which these
mechanisms take place.

Most of the ejected subhaloes are distributed within four times the

velocity distribution around their hosts in comparison to normal haloes.
The number of subhaloes ejected from a host of given mass increases with
the assembly redshift of the host. Ejected subhaloes in general reside
in high-density regions, and have a much higher bias parameter than
normal haloes of the same mass. They also have earlier assembly times,
so that they contribute to the assembly bias of dark matter haloes seen
in cosmological simulations. However, the assembly bias is not dominated
by the ejected population, indicating that large-scale environmental
effects on normal haloes are the main source for the assembly bias.},

We find that this population is significant in number and needs to be appreciated when interpreting the various galaxy morphology environmental relationships and decoupling the degeneracy between nature and nurture. Specifically, we find that approximately half of the galaxies with current cluster-centric distance in the interval 1-2 virial radii of the host are backsplash galaxies that once penetrated deep into the cluster potential, with 90 per cent of these entering to within 50 per cent of the virial radius. These galaxies have undergone significant tidal disruption, losing on average 40 per cent of their mass. This results in a mass function for the backsplash
population different from those galaxies infalling for the first time. We further show that these two populations are kinematically distinct and should be observable within existent spectroscopic surveys.},

In both the observations and the SAM, transition galaxies tend to have
intermediate S\'ersic indices, half-light radii, and surface
stellar mass densities compared to star-forming and quiescent galaxies
out to z = 3. We place an observational upper limit on the average
population transition time-scale as a function of redshift, finding that
the average high-redshift galaxy is on a 'fast track' for quenching
whereas the average low-redshift galaxy is on a 'slow track' for
quenching. We qualitatively identify four physical origin scenarios for
transition galaxies in the SAM: oscillations on the SFMS, slow
quenching, fast quenching, and rejuvenation. Quenching time-scales in
both the SAM and the hydrodynamical simulation are not fast enough to
reproduce the quiescent population that we observe at z $\sim$ 3. In the
SAM, we do not find a clear-cut morphological dependence of quenching

move from galaxies above the SFMS to those below it, we see a nearly
monotonic trend towards higher median S\'ersic index, smaller
radius, lower SFR density, and higher stellar density. In the SAM, bulge
growth is driven by mergers and disc instabilities, and is accompanied
by the growth of a supermassive black hole which can regulate or quench
star formation via active galactic nucleus feedback. We find that our

We compare the observed fractions with predictions from a semi-analytic model which includes prescriptions for bulge growth and AGN feedback due to mergers and disc instabilities. We facilitate direct morphological comparison by
converting our model bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios to S\'ersic indices. We then subdivide our population into the four quadrants of the specific star formation rate-S\'ersic index plane and study the
build-up of each of these subpopulations. We find that the fraction of star-forming discs declines steadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time. The fractions of star-forming spheroids and quiescent discs are both non-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied. Our model is qualitatively successful at reproducing the evolution of the two ‚Äòmain' populations (star-forming discs and quiescent spheroids), and approximately
reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predicts a stronger decline in star-forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent discs, than is seen in the observations. A model with an additional channel for bulge growth via disc instabilities agrees better overall with the observations than a model in which bulges can grow only through mergers.

redshift increases beyond z \texttildelow{} 1, implying that such velocity-mass
relations must change at z $\greaterequivlnt$ 1. By making a realistic model of how
observed galaxy velocities are related to halo circular velocity, we
show that recent optical and radio observations of the abundance of
galaxies are in good agreement with our $\Lambda$CDM simulations. Our
halo demographics are based on updated versions of the ROCKSTAR and
CONSISTENT TREES codes, and this paper includes appendices explaining
all of their outputs. This paper is an introduction to a series of
related papers presenting other analyses of the Bolshoi-Planck and
MultiDark-Planck simulations.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed description of a phenomenological H2 formation model and local star formation prescription based on the density of molecular (rather than total) gas. Such an approach allows us to avoid the arbitrary density and temperature thresholds typically used in star formation recipes in galaxy formation simulations. We present results of the model based on realistic cosmological simulations of high-z galaxy formation for a grid of numerical models with varied dust-to-gas ratios and interstellar far-UV (FUV) fluxes. Our results show that both the atomic-to-molecular transition on small,
tens-of-parsec scales and the Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) relation on large, kiloparsec scales are sensitive to the dust-to-gas ratio and the FUV flux. The atomic-to-molecular transition as a function of gas density or column density has a large scatter but is rather sharp and shifts to higher densities with decreasing dust-to-gas ratio and/or increasing FUV flux. Consequently, star formation is concentrated to higher gas surface density regions, resulting in steeper slope and lower amplitude of the K-S relation at a given $\Sigma$H, in less dusty and/or higher FUV flux environments. We parameterize the dependences observed in our simulations in convenient fitting formulae, which can be used to model the dependence of the K-S relation on the dust-to-gas ratio and FUV flux in semi-analytic models and in cosmological simulations that do not include radiative transfer and H2 formation. Finally, we show that ionized gas can contribute a significant fraction of the total gas surface density in environments typical for high-redshift galaxies.},

We then model the conversion of molecular gas into stars using empirical recipes motivated by recent observations. We explore the impact of these new recipes on the evolution of fundamental galaxy properties such as stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas and stellar phase metallicity. We present predictions for stellar mass functions, stellar mass versus SFR relations, and cold gas phase and stellar mass-metallicity relations for our fiducial models, from redshift z \texttildelow{} 6 to the present day. In addition we present
predictions for the global SFR, mass assembly history, and cosmic enrichment history. We find that the predicted stellar properties of galaxies (stellar mass, SFR, metallicity) are remarkably insensitive to the details of the recipes used for partitioning gas into H I and H2. We see significant sensitivity to the recipes for H2 formation only in very low mass haloes (M\_h $\lessequivlnt$
10\^\{10.5\} M\_\{$\odot$\}), which host galaxies with stellar masses m\_* $\lessequivlnt$
10\^8 M\_\{$\odot$\}. The properties of low-mass galaxies are also quite
insensitive to the details of the recipe used for converting
H2 into stars, while the formation epoch of massive galaxies does depend on this significantly. We argue that this behaviour can be interpreted within the framework of a simple equilibrium model for galaxy evolution, in which the conversion of cold gas into stars is balanced on average by inflows and outflows.},

molecules: one pressure based and one metallicity based. We find that both recipes successfully reproduce the gas fractions and gas-to-stellar mass ratios of H I and H2 in local galaxies, as well as the H I and H2 disc sizes up to z $\leq$ 2. We reach good agreement with the locally observed H I and H2 mass function, although both recipes slightly overpredict the low-mass end of the H I mass function. Both of our models predict that the high-mass end of the H I mass function remains nearly constant at redshifts z $<$ 2.0. The
metallicity-based recipe yields a higher cosmic density of cold gas and much lower cosmic H2 fraction over the entire redshift range probed than the pressure-based recipe. These strong differences in H I mass function and cosmic density between the two recipes are driven by low-mass galaxies (log (M*/M$\odot$) $\leq$ 7)
residing in low-mass haloes (log (Mvir/M$\odot$) $\leq$ 10). Both recipes predict that galaxy gas fractions remain high from z \texttildelow{} 6to3 and drop rapidly at lower redshift. The galaxy
H2 fractions show a similar trend, but drop even more rapidly. We provide predictions for the CO J = 1-0 luminosity of galaxies, which will be directly comparable with observations with sub-mm and radio instruments.},

We find that without disc instabilities, our model does not predict sufficient numbers of intermediate-mass early-type galaxies in the local Universe. Spheroids also form earlier in models with spheroid growth via disc instabilities. Our model correctly predicts the normalization, slope, and scatter of the low-redshift size-mass and Fundamental Plane relations for early-type galaxies. It predicts a degree of curvature in the Faber-Jackson relation that is not seen in local observations, but this could be alleviated if higher mass
spheroids have more bottom-heavy initial mass functions. The model also correctly predicts the observed strong evolution of the size-mass relation for spheroids out to higher redshifts, as well as the slower evolution in the normalization of the Faber-Jackson relation.

regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic

powerful jets that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and

Using a sample of nearby disk-dominated galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and high-redshift data from the GEMS (Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and SEDs) survey, we investigate whether this result is consistent with theoretical expectations within the hierarchical paradigm of structure formation. The relationship between virial radius and mass for dark matter halos in the $\Lambda$CDM model evolves by about a factor of 2 over this interval. However, N-body simulations have shown that halos of a given mass have less centrally concentrated mass profiles at high redshift. When we compute the expected disk size-stellar mass distribution, accounting for this evolution in the internal structure of dark matter halos and the adiabatic contraction of the dark matter by the self-gravity of the collapsing baryons, we find that the predicted evolution in the mean size at fixed stellar mass since z \textasciitilde{} 1 is about 15\%-20\%, in good agreement with the observational constraints from GEMS. At redshift z \textasciitilde{} 2, the model predicts that disks at fixed stellar mass were on average only 60\% as large as they are today. Similarly, we predict that the rotation velocity at a given stellar mass (essentially the zero point of the Tully-Fisher relation) is only about 10\% larger at z \textasciitilde{} 1 (20\% at z \textasciitilde{} 2) than at the present day.},

We consider a ‚Äòcollisional starburst' model in which bursts of star formation are triggered by galaxy-galaxy mergers, and find that a significant fraction of LBGs are predicted to be starbursts. This model reproduces the observed comoving number density of bright LBGs as a function of redshift and the observed luminosity function at z\texttildelow{} 3 and z\texttildelow{} 4, with a reasonable amount of dust extinction. Model
galaxies at z\texttildelow{} 3 have star formation rates, half-light radii, I-K colours and internal velocity dispersions that are in good agreement with the data. Global quantities such as the star formation rate density and cold gas and metal content of the Universe as a function of redshift also agree well. Two ‚Äòquiescent' models without starbursts are also investigated. In one, the star formation efficiency in galaxies remains constant with redshift, while in the other, it scales inversely with disc dynamical time, and thus increases rapidly with redshift. The first quiescent model is strongly ruled out, as it does not produce enough high-redshift galaxies once realistic dust extinction is accounted for. The second quiescent model fits marginally, but underproduces cold gas and very bright galaxies at high redshift. A general conclusion is that star formation at high redshift must be more efficient than locally. The collisional starburst model appears to accomplish this naturally without violating other observational constraints.},

  abstract = {Galaxies strongly self-regulate their growth via energetic feedback from stars, supernovae, and black holes, but these processes are among the least understood aspects of galaxy formation theory. We present an analytic galaxy evolution model that directly constrains such feedback processes from observed galaxy scaling relations. The equilibrium model, which is broadly valid for star-forming central galaxies that dominate cosmic star formation, is based on the ansatz that galaxies live in a slowly evolving equilibrium between inflows, outflows, and star
formation. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain approach, we constrain our model to match observed galaxy scaling relations between stellar mass and halo mass, star formation rate, and metallicity from 0 $<$ z $<$ 2. A good fit ($\chi$2 $\approx$ 1.6) is achieved with
eight free parameters. We further show that constraining our model to any two of the three data sets also produces a fit to the third that is within reasonable systematic uncertainties. The resulting best-fitting parameters that describe baryon cycling suggest galactic outflow scalings intermediate between energy and momentum-driven winds, a weak dependence of wind recycling time on mass, and a quenching mass scale that evolves modestly upwards with redshift. This model further predicts a stellar mass-star formation rate relation that is in good agreement with observations to z \texttildelow{} 6. Our results suggest that this simple analytic framework captures the basic physical processes required to model the mean evolution of stars and metals in galaxies, despite not incorporating many canonical ingredients of galaxy formation models such as merging or disc formation.},

We investigate pre-processing in group haloes, ejected former satellites, and hot gas that extends beyond the virial radius.

Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. This suite of
hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations resolves formation of
star-forming giant molecular clouds to z = 0, and features an explicit
stellar feedback model on small scales. Our simulations reveal that
high-redshift galaxies undergo bursts of star formation followed by
powerful gusts of galactic outflows that eject much of the interstellar
medium and temporarily suppress star formation. At low redshift,
however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to L* progenitors
develop stable discs and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of
star formation that does not drive outflows far into the halo.
Mass-loading factors for winds in L* progenitors are $\eta$ $\approx$ 10 at
high redshift, but decrease to $\eta$ $\ll$ 1 at low redshift. Although
lower values of $\eta$ are expected as haloes grow in mass over time, we
show that the strong suppression of outflows with decreasing redshift
cannot be explained by mass evolution alone. Circumgalactic outflow
velocities are variable and broadly distributed, but typically range
between one and three times the circular velocity of the halo. Much of
the ejected material builds a reservoir of enriched gas within the
circumgalactic medium, some of which could be later recycled to fuel
further star formation. However, a fraction of the gas that leaves the
virial radius through galactic winds is never regained, causing most
haloes with mass Mh $\leq$ 1012 M$\odot$ to

  abstract = {Recent observations indicate that star formation occurs only in the molecular phase of a galaxy's interstellar medium. A realistic treatment of star formation in simulations and analytic models of galaxies therefore requires that one determine where the transition from the atomic to molecular gas occurs. In this paper, we compare two methods for making this determination in cosmological simulations where the internal structures of molecular clouds are unresolved: a complex time-dependent chemistry network coupled to a radiative transfer calculation of the dissociating ultraviolet (UV) radiation field and a simple time-independent analytic approximation. We show that these two methods produce excellent agreement at all metallicities
gsim10-2 of the Milky Way value across a very wide range of UV fields. At lower metallicities the agreement is worse, likely because time-dependent effects become important; however, there are no
observational calibrations of molecular gas content at such low
metallicities, so it is unclear if either method is accurate. The comparison suggests that, in many but not all applications, the analytic approximation provides a viable and nearly cost-free alternative to full time-dependent chemistry and radiative transfer.},

  abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both SPH and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume ‚Äòoverlap'. We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity and cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO:1 this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require ‚Äòartificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow, so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some
advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages versus SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced ‚Äòparticle noise' and numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, and sharp shock-capturing. Advantages versus non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors and numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of ‚Äògrid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous discs, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize ‚Äògrid noise'. These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

  abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of H$\alpha$ to H$\beta$ luminosities, the H$\alpha$ equivalent width, and the
ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to $\lambda$-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A
noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to $\lambda$-0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

The colours of EAGLE galaxies for the more sophisticated models are in broad agreement with those of observed galaxies. In particular, EAGLE produces a red sequence of passive galaxies and a blue cloud of star-forming galaxies, with approximately the correct fraction of galaxies in each population and with g - r colours within 0.1 mag of those observed. Luminosity
functions from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths differ from observations at a level comparable to systematic shifts resulting from a choice between Petrosian and Kron photometric apertures. Despite the generally good agreement there are clear discrepancies with
observations. The blue cloud of EAGLE galaxies extends to somewhat higher luminosities than in the data, consistent with the modest underestimate of the passive fraction in massive EAGLE galaxies. There is also a moderate excess of bright blue galaxies compared to
observations. The overall level of agreement with the observed colour distribution suggests that EAGLE galaxies at z = 0.1 have ages,
metallicities and levels of obscuration that are comparable to those of observed galaxies.},

We argue that the main cause of the catastrophic cooling is a mismatch between the mass of the gas in which the energy is injected and the mass of the parent stellar
population. Because too much mass is heated, the temperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic arguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical resolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected thermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose and test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum temperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both particle-based and grid-based codes. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in dark matter haloes with total mass
1010 and 1012 h-1 M$\odot$. The thermal feedback strongly suppresses the star formation rate and can drive massive, large-scale outflows without the need to turn off radiative cooling temporarily. In accordance with expectations derived from analytic arguments, for sufficiently high resolution the results become insensitive to the imposed temperature jump and also agree with high-resolution simulations employing kinetic feedback.},

parameter space of the ‚ÄòEvolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their
Environments' (EAGLE) simulation project. Four of the simulations follow
the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs
a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star
formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations
each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1.
Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as
observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of
numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar
feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the
fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by injecting more energy
in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed
size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In
the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the
reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of
galaxies with stellar mass $\lessequivlnt$ M$\star$ (the ‚Äòknee' of the
galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback
associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are
also controlled by feedback from accretion on to their central black
holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the
observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been
calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function
will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement
that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of
observables.},

and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical
simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black
holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard $\Lambda$
cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such
simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained
subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major
improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas
without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces,
allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading
factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from
first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar
mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass
relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy
stellar mass function is reproduced to $\lessequivlnt$ 0.2 dex over the full
resolved mass range, 108 $<$ M*/M$\odot$
$\lessequivlnt$ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by
semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations.
We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift
observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement
with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive
fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy
clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O
VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are
consistent with observations for M* $\greaterequivlnt$ 109
M$\odot$ (M* $\greaterequivlnt$ 1010
M$\odot$ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently

temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy
groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating
temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE

the specific SFR is a smoothly decreasing function of the ratio between

framework where the gradual suppression of a galaxy's star
formation activity results from the adjustment to an increase in
specific black hole mass, and accordingly, an increase in the amount of
heating. From this framework, it follows that at least some galaxies
with intermediate specific black hole masses are in a steady state of
partial quiescence with intermediate specific SFRs, implying that both
transitioning and steady-state galaxies live within this region that is
known as the ``green valley.'' With respect to galaxy
formation models, our results present an important diagnostic with which
to test various prescriptions of black hole feedback and its effects on

challenge for galaxy formation models. In this paper, we study the tight
correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass of
galaxies at a given redshift, how halo growth influences star formation,
and star formation histories of individual galaxies. We study these
topics using Illustris, a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation of galaxy formation. Illustris reproduces the observed
relation (the star formation main sequence, SFMS) between SFR and
stellar mass at redshifts z = 0 and 4, but at intermediate redshifts of
z $\simeq$ 1-2, the simulated SFMS has a significantly lower normalization
than reported by observations. The scatter in the relation is consistent
with the observed scatter. However, the fraction of outliers above the
SFR-stellar mass relation in Illustris is less than that observed.
Galaxies with halo masses of \texttildelow{}1012 M$\odot$
dominate the SFR density of the Universe, in agreement with the results
of abundance matching. Furthermore, more-massive galaxies tend to form
the bulk of their stars at high redshift, which indicates that
‚Äòdownsizing' occurs in Illustris. We also studied the star formation
histories of individual galaxies, including the use of a principal
component analysis decomposition. We find that for fixed stellar mass,
galaxies that form earlier have more-massive black holes at z = 0,
indicating that star formation and black hole growth are tightly linked
processes in Illustris. While many of the properties of normal
star-forming galaxies are well reproduced in the Illustris simulation,
forming a realistic population of starbursts will likely require higher
resolution and probably a more sophisticated treatment of star formation
and feedback from stars and black holes.},

  abstract = {We discuss a numerical model for black hole growth and its associated 
feedback processes that for the first time allows cosmological
simulations of structure formation to self-consistently follow the build
up of the cosmic population of galaxies and active galactic nuclei
(AGNs). Our model assumes that seed black holes are present at early
cosmic epochs at the centres of forming haloes. We then track their
growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black holes in the
course of cosmic time. For black holes that are active, we distinguish
between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole
accretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are
assumed to be in a ‚Äòquasar regime', where we model their feedback by
thermally coupling a small fraction of their bolometric luminosity to
the surrounding gas. The quasar activity requires high densities of
relatively cold gas around the black hole, as it is achieved through
large-scale inflows triggered by galaxy mergers. For black holes with
low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedback occurs in
mechanical form, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseous
environment. This regime of activity, which is subdominant in terms of
total black hole mass growth, can be identified with radio galaxies in
clusters of galaxies, and can suppress cluster cooling flows without the
requirement of a triggering by mergers. Using our new model, we carry
out TREESPH cosmological simulations on the scales of individual
galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, both for isolated systems
and for cosmological boxes. We demonstrate that our model produces
results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broad agreement
with observational constraints. We find that the black holes
significantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies, changing
their star formation history, their amount of cold gas and their
colours. Furthermore, the properties of intracluster gas are affected
strongly by the presence of massive black holes in the cores of galaxy
clusters, leading to shallower metallicity and entropy profiles, and to
a suppression of strong cooling flows. Our results support the notion
that AGNs are a key ingredient in cosmological structure formation. They
lead to a self-regulated growth of black holes and bring the simulated
properties of their host galaxies into much better agreement with
observations.},

  abstract = {We present a model for star formation and supernova feedback that 
describes the multiphase structure of star-forming gas on scales that
are typically not resolved in cosmological simulations. Our approach
includes radiative heating and cooling, the growth of cold clouds
embedded in an ambient hot medium, star formation in these clouds,
feedback from supernovae in the form of thermal heating and cloud
evaporation, galactic winds and outflows, and metal enrichment.
Implemented using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, our scheme is a
significantly modified and extended version of the grid-based method of
Yepes et al., and enables us to achieve a high dynamic range in
simulations of structure formation.

We discuss properties of the feedback model in detail and show that it
predicts a self-regulated, quiescent mode of star formation, which, in
particular, stabilizes the star-forming gaseous layers of disc galaxies.
The parametrization of this mode can be reduced to a single free
quantity that determines the overall time-scale for star formation. We
fix this parameter numerically to match the observed rates of star
formation in local disc galaxies. When normalized in this manner,
cosmological simulations employing our model nevertheless overproduce
the observed cosmic abundance of stellar material. We are thus motivated
to extend our feedback model to include galactic winds associated with
star formation.

Using small-scale simulations of individual star-forming disc galaxies,
we show that these winds produce either galactic fountains or outflows,
depending on the depth of the gravitational potential. In low-mass
haloes, winds can greatly suppress the overall efficiency of star
formation. When incorporated into cosmological simulations, our combined
model for star formation and winds predicts a cosmic star formation
density that is consistent with observations, provided that the winds
are sufficiently energetic. Moreover, outflows from galaxies in these
simulations drive chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium - in
principle, accounting for the presence of metals in the Lyman $\alpha$
forest.},

impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The
internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies
obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat
circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation
reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our

Our stellar evolution and chemical enrichment scheme follows nine elements (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe) independently. Stellar feedback is realized through kinetic outflows. The metal mass loading of outflows can be adjusted independently of the wind mass loading. This is required to
simultaneously reproduce the stellar mass content of low-mass haloes and their gas oxygen abundances. Radiative EM AGN feedback is implemented assuming an average spectral energy distribution and a
luminosity-dependent scaling of obscuration effects. This form of feedback suppresses star formation more efficiently than continuous thermal quasar-mode feedback alone, but is less efficient than
mechanical radio-mode feedback in regulating star formation in massive haloes. We contrast simulation predictions for different variants of our galaxy formation model with key observations, allowing us to constrain the importance of different modes of feedback and their uncertain efficiency parameters. We identify a fiducial best match model and show that it reproduces, among other things, the cosmic star formation history, the stellar mass function, the stellar mass-halo mass relation, g-, r-, i- and z-band SDSS galaxy luminosity functions, and the
Tully-Fisher relation. We can achieve this success only if we invoke very strong forms of stellar and AGN feedback such that star formation is adequately reduced in both low- and high-mass systems. In particular, the strength of radio-mode feedback needs to be increased significantly compared to previous studies to suppress efficient cooling in massive, metal-enriched haloes.},

We use high-resolution H I data from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey, CO data from HERACLES and the BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies, 24 $\mu$m data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and UV data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer. We target seven spiral galaxies and 11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how the star formation law differs between the H2 dominated centers of spiral galaxies, their H I dominated outskirts and the H I rich late-type/dwarf galaxies. We find that a Schmidt-type power law with index N = 1.0 $\pm$ 0.2
relates $\Sigma$SFR and $\Sigma$H2 across our sample
of spiral galaxies, i.e., that H2 forms stars at a constant efficiency in spirals. The average molecular gas depletion time is \textasciitilde{}2 \texttimes{} 109 years. The range of $\Sigma$H2 over
which we measure this relation is \textasciitilde{}3-50 M sun
pc-2, significantly lower than in starburst environments. We find the same results when performing a pixel-by-pixel analysis, averaging in radial bins, or when varying the star formation tracer used. We interpret the linear relation and constant depletion time as evidence that stars are forming in giant molecular clouds with
approximately uniform properties and that $\Sigma$H2 may be
more a measure of the filling fraction of giant molecular clouds than changing conditions in the molecular gas. The relationship between total gas surface density ($\Sigma$gas) and $\Sigma$SFR
varies dramatically among and within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show little or no correlation between $\Sigma$HI and
$\Sigma$SFR. As a result, the star formation efficiency (SFE), $\Sigma$SFR/$\Sigma$gas, varies strongly across our
sample and within individual galaxies. We show that this variation is systematic and consistent with the SFE being set by local environmental factors: in spirals the SFE is a clear function of radius, while the dwarf galaxies in our sample display SFEs similar to those found in the outer optical disks of the spirals. We attribute the similarity to common environments (low density, low metallicity, H I dominated) and argue that shear (which is typically absent in dwarfs) cannot drive the SFE. In addition to a molecular Schmidt law, the other general feature of our sample is a sharp saturation of H I surface densities at
$\Sigma$HI $\approx$ 9 M sun pc-2 in both the
spiral and dwarf galaxies. In the case of the spirals, we observe gas in excess of this limit to be molecular.},

Most methods fall into two broad groups: those that use nearest neighbours to probe the underlying density field and those that use fixed apertures. The differences between the two inhibit a clean comparison between analyses and leave open the possibility that, even with the same data, different properties are actually being measured. In this work, we apply 20 published environment definitions to a common mock galaxy catalogue constrained to look like the local Universe. We find that
nearest-neighbour-based measures best probe the internal densities of high-mass haloes, while at low masses the interhalo separation dominates and acts to smooth out local density variations. The resulting
correlation also shows that nearest-neighbour galaxy environment is largely independent of dark matter halo mass. Conversely, aperture-based methods that probe superhalo scales accurately identify high-density regions corresponding to high-mass haloes. Both methods show how galaxies in dense environments tend to be redder, with the exception of the largest apertures, but these are the strongest at recovering the background dark matter environment. We also warn against using
photometric redshifts to define environment in all but the densest regions. When considering environment, there are two regimes: the 'local environment' internal to a halo best measured with nearest neighbour and 'large-scale environment' external to a halo best measured with
apertures. This leads to the conclusion that there is no universal environment measure and the most suitable method depends on the scale being probed.},

the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z$\approx$1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than \texttildelow{}1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), and the intracluster
light (ICL) as a function of halo mass. Our results are consistent with
observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates

consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results,
including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass
function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our
method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass
function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates
out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more
recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic
stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include:
halos near 1012 M $\odot$ are the most efficient
at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of
massive halos drops markedly after z \textasciitilde{} 2.5 (consistent with theories of
cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be
significant out to at least z \textasciitilde{} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low
redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous
expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we
provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the
standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of
observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent
framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in
$\Lambda$CDM. Constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relationship and
SFRs are available for download online.},

  abstract = {Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared
measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. The data show a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z\textasciitilde{}6, with especially tight constraints for z$<$\textasciitilde{}1. We fit these data with simple analytical forms and derive conservative uncertainties. Since the z$<$\textasciitilde{}1 SFH data are quite precise, we
investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalization to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalization, we consider the evolution in stellar and metal mass densities, and
supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalization is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalization, we consider the Super-Kamiokande limit on the electron antineutrino ($\nu$e) flux from past
core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z$<$\textasciitilde{}1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from
supernova events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses ($<$\textasciitilde{}1 Msolar), and we show that recently favored IMFs are also constrained. In
particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. To resolve the outstanding issues, improved data are called for on the supernova rate density evolution, the ranges of stellar masses leading to core-collapse and type Ia supernovae, and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from core-collapse supernovae.},

Here I explore the relative importance of these various effects, finding that mergers and other processes are unlikely to convert more than 10\% of the blue galaxy sequence into red galaxies in that time period. I compare the galaxy population at redshift z\textasciitilde{}0.1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to the sample at z\textasciitilde{}1 from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2). Galaxies are bluer at z\textasciitilde{}1: the blue sequence by about 0.3 mag and the red sequence by about 0.1 mag in 0.1(u-g). I evaluate the change in color and in the luminosity functions of the two sequences using some simplistic stellar population synthesis models. These models indicate that the luminous end of the red sequence fades less than passive evolution allows by about 0.2 mag. Due to a lack of luminous blue progenitors, ‚Äò‚Äòdry'' mergers between red galaxies then must create the luminous red population at z\textasciitilde{}0.1 if the stellar population models and flux estimates are correct. The blue-sequence colors and luminosity function are consistent with a reduction in the star formation rate since z\textasciitilde{}1 (by at least a factor of about 3, although this study does not constrain the exact number well), with no change in the number density to within 10\%. These results restrict the number of blue galaxies that can fall onto the red sequence by any process, and in particular suggest that if mergers are catastrophic events, they must be rare for blue galaxies.},

mass of blue galaxies with young stars has not significantly changed

identify a mass limit, MQ, above which star formation appears

downsizing can thus be empirically quantified by charting the evolution

by a factor of \textasciitilde{}3 across our redshift range according to
MQ\textasciitilde{}(1+z)3.5. To further constrain possible
quenching mechanisms, we investigate how downsizing depends on local
galaxy environment using the projected third-nearest-neighbor statistic
Dp,3. For the majority of galaxies near the median density,
there is no significant correlation between downsizing and environment.
However, a trend is observed in the comparison between environments that
are more than 3 times overdense or underdense relative to the median.
Here, downsizing appears accelerated in overdense regions that host
higher numbers of massive, early-type galaxies as compared to the
underdense regions. Our results significantly constrain recent
suggestions for the origin of downsizing and indicate that the process
for quenching star formation must, primarily, be internally driven.},

An empirical relation between the distribution functions of total
stellar mass of galaxies and host halo mass, tuned to match the spatial
density of galaxies over 0 $<$ z $<$ 2 and the clustering properties
at z \texttildelow{} 0, is extended to include two different scenarios
describing the variation of SFR on Mh. We also present new
measurements of the redshift evolution of the average SFR for
star-forming galaxies of different stellar masses up to z = 2, using
data from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey for infrared
bright galaxies.

Combining the EHM with the halo accretion histories from numerical
simulations, we trace the stellar mass growth and star-formation history
in haloes spanning a range of masses. We find that: (1) the intensity of
the star-forming activity in haloes in the probed mass range has
steadily decreased from z \texttildelow{} 2 to 0; (2) at a given epoch, haloes
in the mass range between a few times 1011 M$\odot$
and a few times 1012 M$\odot$ are the most efficient
at hosting star formation; (3) the peak of SFR density shifts to lower
mass haloes over time; and (4) galaxies that are forming stars most
actively at z \texttildelow{} 2 evolve into quiescent galaxies in today's group
environments, strongly supporting previous claims that the most powerful
starbursts at z \texttildelow{} 2 are progenitors of today's elliptical

extragalactic fields GOODS-North, GOODS-South, UDS, and COSMOS obtained

formation picture provided by a total of 10 497 individual far-infrared
detections is supplemented by the stacking analysis of a mass complete
sample of 62 361 star-forming galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) H band-selected catalogs of the CANDELS survey and from two deep
ground-based Ks band-selected catalogs in the GOODS-North and
the COSMOS-wide field to obtain one of the most accurate and unbiased
understanding to date of the stellar mass growth over the cosmic
history. We show, for the first time, that stacking also provides a
powerful tool to determine the dispersion of a physical correlation and
describe our method called "scatter stacking", which may be easily
generalized to other experiments. The combination of direct UV and
far-infrared UV-reprocessed light provides a complete census on the star
formation rates (SFRs), allowing us to demonstrate that galaxies at z =
4 to 0 of all stellar masses (M${_\ast}$) follow a universal
scaling law, the so-called main sequence of star-forming galaxies. We
find a universal close-to-linear slope of the log 10(SFR)-log
10(M${_\ast}$) relation, with evidence for a
flattening of the main sequence at high masses (log
10(M${_\ast}$/M$\odot$) $>$ 10.5) that
becomesless prominent with increasing redshift and almost vanishes by z
$\simeq$ 2. This flattening may be due to the parallel stellar growth of
quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies, which mostly happens over the
same redshift range. Within the main sequence, we measure a nonvarying
SFR dispersion of 0.3 dex: at a fixed redshift and stellar mass, about
68\% of star-forming galaxies form stars at a universal rate within a
factor 2. The specific SFR (sSFR = SFR/M${_\ast}$) of
star-forming galaxies is found to continuously increase from z = 0 to 4.
Finally we discuss the implications of our findings on the cosmic SFR
history and on the origin of present-day stars: more than two-thirds of
present-day stars must have formed in a regime dominated by the "main
sequence" mode. As a consequence we conclude that, although omnipresent
in the distant Universe, galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping the
global star formation history over the last 12.5 billion years.

\texttimes{} 1010 Msolar. Lower-mass galaxies have
young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the low
concentrations typical of discs. Their star formation histories are more
strongly correlated with surface mass density than with stellar mass. A
significant fraction of the lowest-mass galaxies in our sample have
experienced recent starbursts. At given stellar mass, the sizes of
low-mass galaxies are lognormally distributed with dispersion
$\sigma$(lnR50) \textasciitilde{} 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea
that they form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and
condensation in a gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. Their
median stellar surface mass density scales with stellar mass as
$\mu$*\textasciitilde{}M0.54*, suggesting that the
stellar mass of a disc galaxy is proportional to the three halves power
of its halo mass. All of this suggests that the efficiency of the
conversion of baryons into stars in low-mass galaxies increases in
proportion to halo mass, perhaps as a result of supernova feedback
processes. At stellar masses above 3 \texttimes{} 1010
Msolar, there is a rapidly increasing fraction of galaxies
with old stellar populations, high surface mass densities and the high
concentrations typical of bulges. In this regime, the size distribution
remains lognormal, but its dispersion decreases rapidly with increasing
mass and the median stellar mass surface density is approximately
constant. This suggests that the star formation efficiency decreases in
the highest-mass haloes, and that little star formation occurs in
massive galaxies after they have assembled.},

  abstract = {Using photometry and spectroscopy of 183,487 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we present bivariate distributions of pairs of seven galaxy properties: four optical colors, surface brightness, radial profile shape as measured by the S\'ersic index, and absolute
magnitude. In addition, we present the dependence of local galaxy density (smoothed on 8 h-1 Mpc scales) on all of these properties. Several classic, well-known relations among galaxy
properties are evident at extremely high signal-to-noise ratio: the color-color relations of galaxies, the color-magnitude relations, the magnitude-surface brightness relation, and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude. We show that most of the i-band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used: -23.50.1i$<$-17.0
mag and 17$<\mu$0.1i$<$24 mag in 1
arcsec2 [the notation zb represents the b band shifted blueward by a factor (1+z)]. Some of the relationships between parameters, in particular the color-magnitude relations, show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together. We provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies and other quantitative details of our results.

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for identifying dark matter halos, 
substructure, and tidal features. The approach is based on adaptive
hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space
dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust
(grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of
substructure; as such, it is named ROCKSTAR (Robust Overdensity
Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method
is massively parallel (up to 105 CPUs) and runs on the
largest current simulations ($>$1010 particles) with high
efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion
particles analyzed). A previous paper has shown ROCKSTAR to have
excellent recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons
with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant
improvement in substructure recovery compared to several other halo
finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations
in this regard. Finally, we present results that demonstrate
conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the
halo bulk or substructure average velocities and have coherent velocity
offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive
clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km s-1 at z =
0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly
available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar.},

Within its virial radius this model contains about 2\texttimes{}107 dark
matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure
identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

We achieve this precision by comparing stacked spectra across tiny redshift intervals. The redshift intervals must be small enough that any systematic stellar population evolution is minimized and is less than the
spectrophotometric uncertainty. This purely empirical technique does not require any theoretical knowledge of true galaxy spectra. It can be applied to all large spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys that sample a large number of galaxies in a uniform population.},

  abstract = {Passive red galaxies frequently contain warm ionized gas and have spectra similar to low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions
(LINERs). Here we investigate the nature of the ionizing sources powering this emission, by comparing nuclear spectroscopy from the Palomar survey with larger aperture data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find the line emission in the majority of passive red galaxies is spatially extended; the H$\alpha$ surface brightness profile depends on radius r as r -1.28. We detect strong line ratio gradients with radius in [N II]/H$\alpha$, [S II]/H$\alpha$, and [O
III]/[S II], requiring the ionization parameter to increase outward. Combined with a realistic gas density profile, this outward increasing ionization parameter convincingly rules out active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as the dominant ionizing source and strongly favors distributed ionizing sources. Sources that follow the stellar density profile can additionally reproduce the observed luminosity dependence of the line ratio gradient. Post-asymptotic giant branch stars provide a natural ionization source candidate, though they have an ionization parameter deficit. Velocity width differences among different emission lines disfavor shocks as the dominant ionization mechanism, and suggest that the interstellar medium in these galaxies contains multiple components. We conclude that the line emission in most LINER-like galaxies found in large-aperture ($>$100 pc) spectroscopy is not primarily powered by AGN activity and thus does not trace the AGN bolometric luminosity. However, they can be used to trace warm gas in these red galaxies.},

sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54\% for log (M sstarf) $>$ 10 at 1 $<$ z $<$ 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust
obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11\%), and (3) dusty, blue
star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7\%). The remaining 28\% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

derive robust estimates of dust masses (M dust) for
main-sequence (MS) galaxies, which obey a tight correlation between star
formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M *), and for
starbursting galaxies that fall outside that relation. Exploiting the
correlation of gas-to-dust mass with metallicity (M gas/M
dust-Z), we use our measurements to constrain the gas
content, CO-to-H2 conversion factors ($\alpha$CO),
and star formation efficiencies (SFE) of these distant galaxies. Using
large statistical samples, we confirm that $\alpha$CO and SFE
are an order of magnitude higher and lower, respectively, in MS galaxies
at high redshifts compared to the values of local galaxies with
equivalently high infrared luminosities (L IR $>$
1012 L $\odot$). For galaxies within the MS, we
show that the variations of specific star formation rates (sSFRs = SFR/M
*) are driven by varying gas fractions. For relatively
massive galaxies like those in our samples, we show that the hardness of
the radiation field, langUrang, which is proportional to the
dust-mass-weighted luminosity (L IR/M dust) and
the primary parameter defining the shape of the IR spectral energy
distribution (SED), is equivalent to SFE/Z. For MS galaxies with stellar
mass log (M */M $\odot$) $>$= 9.7 we measure this
quantity, langUrang, showing that it does not depend significantly on
either the stellar mass or the sSFR. This is explained as a simple
consequence of the existing correlations between SFR-M *, M
*-Z, and M gas-SFR. Instead, we show that
langUrang (or equally L IR/M dust) does evolve,
with MS galaxies having harder radiation fields and thus warmer
temperatures as redshift increases from z = 0 to 2, a trend that can
also be understood based on the redshift evolution of the M
*-Z and SFR-M * relations. These results motivate
the construction of a universal set of SED templates for MS galaxies
that are independent of their sSFR or M * but vary as a
function of redshift with only one parameter, langUrang.},

the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data

L8$\mu$m$>$1011 Lsolar, show a mid-IR
excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as
shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear
correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 $\mu$m-detected galaxies.
For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of \textasciitilde{}4 and \textasciitilde{}30
relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z=1 and 0, respectively.
Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively
‚Äò‚Äòtransparent'' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived

submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star
formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests
that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity.
Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the

comes from virialized cluster cores, where ellipticals are the dominant
population. The net result is that a meaningful comparison of the
clustering strength of different morphological types can be performed
only in real space, i.e., after projecting out the redshift distortions
on the two-point correlation function $\xi$(rp, $\pi$). A
power-law fit to the projected function wp(rp) on
scales smaller than 10 h-1 Mpc gives
r0=8.35+0.75-0.76 h-1 Mpc,
$\gamma$=2.05+0.10-0.08 for the early-type

865+250-165 km s-1 for early-type

  abstract = {No modern astronomer made a more profound contribution to our understanding  
of the cosmos than did Edwin Hubble, who first conclusively demonstrated that
the universe is expanding.  Basing his theory on the observation of the
change in spectra of distant galaxies, called red shift, Hubble showed that
this is a Doppler effect, or alteration in the wavelength of light, resulting
from the rapid motion of celestial objects away from Earth.

Hubble's discovery confirmed an equation previously arrived at by Einstein --
who, however, had not trusted his own figures until Hubble proved their
accuracy.  Hubble supported his theory with careful measurements, but found a
rate of expansion (called Hubble's constant) that was far too high because he
assumed that other galaxies were much nearer our Milky Way than they are.
On the other hand, Hubble's law, relating the distance of a galaxy to its
recession velocity, remains essentially unchanged.

In 1935 Hubble described his principal observations and conclusions in the
Silliman lectures at Yale University.  These lectures were published the
following year as The Realm of the Nebulae, which quickly became a classic
work.  It is here reprinted with an introduction by James E. Gunn.},

We examine the relative number of quenched versus star-forming dwarf galaxies, defining quenched galaxies as having no H$\alpha$ emission
(EWH$\alpha$ $<$ 2 \AA{}) and a strong 4000 \AA{} break.
The fraction of quenched dwarf galaxies decreases rapidly with
increasing distance from a massive host, leveling off for distances beyond 1.5 Mpc. We define galaxies beyond 1.5 Mpc of a massive host galaxy to be in the field. We demonstrate that there is a stellar mass threshold of M stellar $<$ 1.0 \texttimes{} 109 M
$\odot$ below which quenched galaxies do not exist in the
field. Below this threshold, we find that none of the 2951 field dwarf galaxies are quenched; all field dwarf galaxies show evidence for recent star formation. Correcting for volume effects, this corresponds to a 1$\sigma$ upper limit on the quenched fraction of 0.06\%. In more dense
environments, quenched galaxies account for 23\% of the dwarf population over the same stellar mass range. The majority of quenched dwarf galaxies (often classified as dwarf elliptical galaxies) are within 2 virial radii of a massive galaxy, and only a few percent of quenched dwarf galaxies exist beyond 4 virial radii. Thus, for galaxies with stellar mass less than 1.0 \texttimes{} 109 M $\odot$,
ending star formation requires the presence of a more massive neighbor, providing a stringent constraint on models of star formation feedback.},

  abstract = {Clustering of dark matter halos has been shown to depend on halo properties beyond mass such as halo concentration, a phenomenon referred to as halo assembly bias. Standard halo occupation modeling (HOD) in large scale structure studies assumes that halo mass alone is sufficient in characterizing the connection between galaxies and halos. Modeling of galaxy clustering can face systematic effects if the number of galaxies are correlated with other halo properties. Using the Small MultiDark-Planck high resolution \$N\$-body simulation and the measurements of the projected two-point correlation function and the number density of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 main galaxy sample, we investigate the extent to which the dependence of halo occupation on halo concentration can be constrained, and to what extent allowing for this dependence can improve our modeling of galaxy clustering. Given the SDSS clustering data, our constraints on HOD with assembly bias, suggests that satellite population is not correlated with halo concentration at fixed halo mass. Furthermore, in terms of the occupation of centrals at fixed halo mass, our results favor lack of correlation with halo concentration in the most luminous samples (\$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-21.5,-21\$), modest levels of correlation for \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-20.5,-20, -19.5\$ samples, lack of correlation for \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-19,-18.5\$ samples, and anti-correlation for the faintest sample \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm r\}$<$-18\$. We show that in comparison with abundance-matching mock catalogs, our findings suggest qualitatively similar but modest levels of the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering. That is, the effect is only present in the central occupation and becomes less significant in brighter galaxy samples. Furthermore, by performing model comparison based on information criteria, we find that in most cases, the mass-only HOD model is still favored by the observations.},

  abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today, due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon (\$z$\backslash$sim 2-3\$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

  abstract = {We examine the growth and evolution of quenched galaxies in the Mufasa cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include an evolving halo mass-based quenching prescription, with galaxy colours computed accounting for line-of-sight extinction to individual star particles. Mufasa reproduces the observed present-day red sequence quite well, including its slope, amplitude, and scatter. In Mufasa, the red sequence slope is driven entirely by the steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees with observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red sequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*$>$10\^10.5 Mo. The most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass via dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold inflows more effectively penetrate hot halos. To higher redshifts, the red sequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming galaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems show good agreement with observations out to z\textasciitilde{}2, despite not including a rapid early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched galaxies are far too numerous at z$<$1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly over-quenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise a quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and keeps them quenched to z=0, while not being so strong as to over-quench satellites; Mufasa only succeeds at the former.},

the fidelity of group catalogue inferred statistics, we run three
different group finders used in the literature over a mock that includes
galaxy colours in a realistic manner. Overall, the resulting mock group
catalogues are remarkably similar, and most colour-dependent statistics
are recovered with reasonable accuracy. However, it is also clear that
certain systematic errors arise as a consequence of correlated errors in
group membership determination, central/satellite designation, and halo
mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo transition
probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these
errors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of
distinct galaxy populations (i.e. red versus blue galaxies or centrals
versus satellites), and to result in inferred occupation statistics that
are more accurate for red galaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic
that is particularly poorly recovered from the group catalogues is the
red fraction of central galaxies as a function of halo mass. Group
finders do a good job in recovering galactic conformity, but also have a
tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is present. We conclude
that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from group
catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e. running group
finders over mock data) or by implementing a correction scheme based on
the HTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model dependent.},

group/cluster catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, together with

enhanced SFR quenching out to 2.5 virial radii beyond groups/clusters,

explained simply by ‚Äòejected' satellite galaxies that orbit beyond their

orbit for several Gyr beyond the virial radius before falling back in,
and thus they compose up to 40 per cent of all central galaxies near
groups/clusters. We show that a model in which ejected satellites
experience the same SFR quenching as satellites within a host halo can
explain essentially all environmental dependence of galaxy quenching.
Furthermore, ejected satellites (continue to) lose significant halo
mass, an effect that is potentially observable via gravitational
lensing. The SFRs/colours and stellar-to-halo masses of ejected
satellites highlight the importance of environmental history and present
challenges to models of galaxy occupation that ignore such history.},

regardless of central satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal
SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR $\approx$ 10-11
yr-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever
an excess of galaxies in the 'green valley'. Satellite galaxies are
simply more likely to lie on the quenched ('red sequence') side of the
SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess
above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar
mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups
with halo masses down to 3 \texttimes{} 1011 M$\odot$ and
increases strongly with halo mass and towards halo centre. We find no
detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond \texttildelow{}2
Rvir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been
decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1)
galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they
cross within \texttildelow{}Rvir of a more massive host halo; (2)
after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in
the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyr; and (3) once
begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. These results
place strong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as
we will discuss further in companion papers.},

By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z $<$ 0.2. We develop a
method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be

Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the
low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* $>$ 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is
0.408+0.005-0.002

(systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance
cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of
7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-\AA{}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the
Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m$>$\textasciitilde{}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc\textasciitilde{}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass $\sigma$\textasciitilde{}0.7,
whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc\textasciitilde{}0.2
Msolar and $\sigma$\textasciitilde{}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD\textasciitilde{}n*\textasciitilde{}0.1
pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages $>$\textasciitilde{}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust
grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc\textasciitilde{}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \textasciitilde{}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These
conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.

These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv\'enic conditions, seem to reproduce both
qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

  volume = {1107},
  abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to
decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f\_q, and
large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f\_q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f\_q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal $<$\textasciitilde{} 10\^10.0 Msol/h\^2), there is no correlation between f\_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120$^\circ$ long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250
deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky
determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

(NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z\textasciitilde{}0.3) based on a
set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319
galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift
determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright
stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the
spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85\%
completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed
the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation
function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will
follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches
to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended
Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the
Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue
of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm
survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and
spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and
structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here
is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that
distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more
appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic
calibration errors across the sky from \textasciitilde{}2\% to \textasciitilde{}1\%. We include an
explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all
imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position.
Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of
objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in
deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers
in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently
small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and
large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.

systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF
of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z = 1, although we do
find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a $\approx$30\%
increase in the number density of \textasciitilde{}1010 \{M\}\_\{$\backslash$odot \}

toward low redshift, by a factor of \textasciitilde{}2-3 since z $\approx$ 0.6, while the
number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant

the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of
SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend
\textasciitilde{}67\%(95\%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of $<$\textasciitilde{}2(4) of
their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of

average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of
starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in
starbursts. LIRGs at z\textasciitilde{}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for
massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same

star formation rates (SFRs) and lie on the ‚Äòred sequence' than central
(‚Äòfield') galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, together with a high-resolution,
cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the
star formation histories and quenching time-scales of satellites of
Mstar $>$ 5 \texttimes{} 109 M$\odot$ at z
$\approx$ 0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing
and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and
properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z
\texttildelow{} 0.5, or \texttildelow{}5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions
for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct
an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs
and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and
efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host
halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for
building up all quiescent galaxies at Mstar $<$
1010 M$\odot$. We then constrain satellite star
formation histories, finding a ‚Äòdelayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario:
satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which
star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of $<$0.8 Gyr.
These quenching time-scales are shorter for more massive satellites but
do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in the satellite
quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites
quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing),
which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive
clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts,
satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall,
nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical
insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

  abstract = {We measure star formation rates of \textasciitilde{}50,000 optically-selected galaxies in the local universe (z\textasciitilde{}0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS (optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include dust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect agreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated with an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and for (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN, while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence) galaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha emission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at z=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).},

Thus, the mechanism(s) responsible for quenching central galaxies plays a crucial role in galaxy evolution as whole. We combine a high resolution cosmological \$N\$-body simulation with observed evolutionary trends of the "star formation main sequence," quiescent fraction, and stellar mass function at \$z $<$ 1\$ to construct a model that statistically tracks the star formation histories and quenching of central galaxies. Comparing this model to the distribution of central galaxy star formation rates in a group catalog of the SDSS Data Release 7, we constrain the timescales over which physical processes cease star formation in central galaxies. Over the stellar mass range \$10\^\{9.5\}\$ to \$10\^\{11\} $\backslash$mathrm\{M\}\_$\backslash$odot\$ we infer quenching e-folding times that span \$1.5\$ to \$0.5$\backslash$; $\backslash$mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ with more massive central galaxies quenching faster. For \$$\backslash$mathcal\{M\}\_* = 10\^\{10.5\}$\backslash$mathrm\{M\}\_$\backslash$odot\$, this implies a total migration time of \$$\backslash$sim 4\textasciitilde$\backslash$mathrm\{Gyrs\}\$ from the star formation main sequence to quiescence. Compared to satellites, central galaxies take \$$\backslash$sim 2\textasciitilde$\backslash$mathrm\{Gyrs\}\$ longer to quench their star formation, suggesting that different mechanisms are responsible for quenching centrals versus satellites. Finally, the central galaxy quenching timescale we infer provides key constraints for proposed star formation quenching mechanisms. Our timescale is generally consistent with gas depletion timescales predicted by quenching through strangulation. However, the exact physical mechanism(s) responsible for this still remain unclear.},

Understanding of galaxy evolution rests on longitudinal interpretations of how these data relate to individual objects moving through time. The connection between the two is generally assumed to be clear, but we use a simple "physics-free" model to show that it is not and that exploring its nuances can lead to new insights. Comprising nothing more than \$$\backslash$sim2000\$ loosely constrained lognormal star formation histories, the model faithfully reproduces the following data it was never designed to match: stellar mass functions at \$z$\backslash$leq8\$; the slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the SF "Main Sequence") at \$z$\backslash$leq6\$; the mean \$\{$\backslash$rm sSFR\}($\backslash$equiv\{$\backslash$rm SFR\}/M\_*)\$ of low-mass galaxies at \$z$\backslash$leq7\$; "fast-" and "slow-track quenching"; galaxy downsizing; and a correlation between formation timescale and \$\{$\backslash$rm sSFR\}(M\_*,t)\$ similar to recent results from simulations that provides a natural connection to bulge growth. We take these surprising findings -- which ultimately imply that quenching is the "peeling-off" of the densest tail of the starforming population at any epoch -- to mean either that: (1) models in which galaxies are diversified on long timescales by something akin to initial conditions rival the dominant "grow-and-quench" framework as good descriptions of the data; or (2) cornerstone metrics of galaxy evolution are too information-poor -- if not intrinsically misleading -- to confirm a unique explanation. We outline future tests of our model but stress that, even if it is shown to be incorrect, it illustrates how exploring different evolutionary paradigms can aid learning and, we hope, more detailed modeling efforts.},

  title = {The Failure of Stellar Feedback, Magnetic Fields, Conduction, and Morphological Quenching in Maintaining Red Galaxies},
  abstract = {The quenching "maintenance'" and related "cooling flow" problems are important in galaxies from Milky Way mass through clusters. We investigate this in halos with masses \$$\backslash$sim 10\^\{12\}-10\^\{14\}$\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm M\}\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, using non-cosmological high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations with the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model. We specifically focus on physics present without AGN, and show that various proposed "non-AGN" solution mechanisms in the literature, including Type Ia supernovae, shocked AGB winds, other forms of stellar feedback (e.g. cosmic rays), magnetic fields, Spitzer-Braginskii conduction, or "morphological quenching" do not halt or substantially reduce cooling flows nor maintain "quenched" galaxies in this mass range. We show that stellar feedback (including cosmic rays from SNe) alters the balance of cold/warm gas and the rate at which the cooled gas within the galaxy turns into stars, but not the net baryonic inflow. If anything, outflowing metals and dense gas promote additional cooling. Conduction is important only in the most massive halos, as expected, but even at \$$\backslash$sim 10\^\{14\}$\backslash$,\{$\backslash$rm M\}\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$ reduces inflow only by a factor \$$\backslash$sim 2\$ (owing to saturation effects and anisotropic suppression). Changing the morphology of the galaxies only slightly alters their Toomre-\$Q\$ parameter, and has no effect on cooling (as expected), so has essentially no effect on cooling flows or maintaining quenching. This all supports the idea that additional physics, e.g., AGN feedback, must be important in massive galaxies.},

  abstract = {We introduce an updated physical model to simulate the formation and evolution of galaxies in cosmological, large-scale
gravity+magnetohydrodynamical simulations with the moving mesh code AREPO. The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic outflows, and black hole formation, growth and multimode feedback. In this paper, we give a comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances that form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content and energy
scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black-hole-driven kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics and improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc
h-1)3 cosmological boxes, we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a
self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important impact on the stellar content of 1012 M$\odot$
haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching observational constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of the low-mass end of the galaxy population.},

MBII is the highest resolution simulation of this size which includes a
self-consistent model for star formation, black hole accretion and associated feedback. We provide a simulation browser web application which enables interactive search and tagging of the MBII data set and publicly release our galaxy catalogues. We find that baryons affect strongly the halo mass function (MF), with 20-33 per cent change in the halo abundance below the knee of the MF (Mhalo $<$
1013.2 M$\odot$ h-1 at z = 0) when
compared to dark-matter-only simulations. We provide a fitting function for the halo MF out to redshift z = 11 and discuss its limitations. We study the halo occupation distribution and clustering of galaxies, in particular the evolution and scale dependence of stochasticity and bias finding reasonable agreement with observational data. The shape of the cosmic spectral energy distribution of galaxies in MBII is consistent with observations, but lower in amplitude. The Galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) function is broadly consistent with observations at z $\geq$ 2. At z $<$ 2, the population of passive low-mass (M* $<$ 109 M$\odot$) galaxies in MBII makes the GSMF
too steep compared to observations whereas at the high-mass end
(M* $>$ 1011 M$\odot$) galaxies hosting bright AGNs make significant contributions to the GSMF. The quasar bolometric luminosity function is also largely consistent with
observations. We note however that more efficient AGN feedback is necessary for the largest, rarest objects/clusters at low redshifts.},

such as the relation between galaxies' star formation rates (SFRs) and
stellar masses (M*) and the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation.
We demonstrate that comparisons of the short-time-scale variability in
galaxy SFRs with observational data provide an additional useful
constraint on the physics of galaxy formation feedback. We apply SFR
indicators with different sensitivity time-scales to galaxies from the
Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. We find that the
SFR-M* relation has a significantly greater scatter when the
H$\alpha$-derived SFR is considered compared with when the
far-ultraviolet (FUV)-based SFR is used. This difference is a direct
consequence of bursty star formation because the FIRE galaxies exhibit
order-of-magnitude SFR variations over time-scales of a few Myr. We show
that the difference in the scatter between the simulated H$\alpha$- and
FUV-derived SFR-M* relations at z = 2 is consistent with
observational constraints. We also find that the H$\alpha$/FUV ratios
predicted by the simulations at z = 0 are similar to those observed for
local galaxies except for a population of low-mass (M* $\lessequivlnt$
109.5 M$\odot$) simulated galaxies with lower
H$\alpha$/FUV ratios than observed. We suggest that future cosmological

These components are: dark matter particles, gas cells, passive gas tracers, stars and stellar wind particles, and supermassive black holes. This data release includes the snapshots at all 136 available redshifts, halo and subhalo catalogs at each snapshot, and two distinct merger trees. Six primary
realizations of the Illustris volume are released, including the flagship Illustris-1 run. These include three resolution levels with the fiducial ;full; baryonic physics model, and a dark matter only analog for each. In addition, we provide four distinct, high time resolution, smaller volume ;subboxes;. The total data volume is $\sim$265 TB,
including $\sim$800 full volume snapshots and $\sim$30,000 subbox
snapshots. We describe the released data products as well as tools we have developed for their analysis. All data may be directly downloaded in its native HDF5 format. Additionally, we release a comprehensive, web-based API which allows programmatic access to search and data processing tasks. In both cases we provide example scripts and a getting-started guide in several languages: currently, IDL, Python, and Matlab. This paper addresses scientific issues relevant for the

an enhanced version of the GADGET code that includes a modified
hydrodynamics solver, time-step limiter and subgrid treatments of
baryonic physics, such as stellar mass loss, element-by-element
radiative cooling, star formation and feedback from star formation and
black hole accretion. The simulation suite includes runs performed in
volumes ranging from 25 to 100 comoving megaparsecs per side, with
numerical resolution chosen to marginally resolve the Jeans mass of the
gas at the star formation threshold. The free parameters of the subgrid
models for feedback are calibrated to the redshift z = 0 galaxy stellar
mass function, galaxy sizes and black hole mass-stellar mass relation.
The simulations have been shown to match a wide range of observations
for present-day and higher-redshift galaxies. The raw particle data have
been used to link galaxies across redshifts by creating merger trees.
The indexing of the tree produces a simple way to connect a galaxy at
one redshift to its progenitors at higher redshift and to identify its
descendants at lower redshift. In this paper we present a relational
database which we are making available for general use. A large number
of properties of haloes and galaxies and their merger trees are stored
in the database, including stellar masses, star formation rates,
metallicities, photometric measurements and mock gri images. Complex
queries can be created to explore the evolution of more than
105 galaxies, examples of which are provided in the Appendix.
The relatively good and broad agreement of the simulations with a wide
range of observational datasets makes the database an ideal resource for
the analysis of model galaxies through time, and for connecting and
interpreting observational datasets.},

  abstract = {Star-formation rates (SFR) of disk galaxies strongly correlate with stellar mass, with a small dispersion in SSFR at fixed mass, sigma\textasciitilde{}0.3 dex. With such small scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as deterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple consequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by approximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a random walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at the previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of star-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for stochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are correlated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an expectation that  should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have a relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and its evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to constrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important observables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation. The evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways to generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as mergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the classification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous formation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their star-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's insensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the ability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic baselines.

  shorttitle = {Galaxy {{And Mass Assembly}} ({{GAMA}})},
  abstract = {Aims. We aim to investigate if the environment (characterised by the host dark matter halo mass) plays any role in shaping the galaxy star formation main sequence (MS). Methods. The Galaxy and Mass Assembly project (GAMA) combines a spectroscopic survey with photometric information in 21 bands from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the far-infrared (FIR). Stellar masses and dust-corrected star-formation rates (SFR) are derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling using MAGPHYS. We use the GAMA galaxy group catalogue to examine the variation of the fraction of star-forming galaxies (SFG) and properties of the MS with respect to the environment. Results. We examine the environmental dependence for stellar mass selected samples without preselecting star-forming galaxies and study any dependence on the host halo mass separately for centrals and satellites out to z \textasciitilde{} 0.3. We find the SFR distribution at fixed stellar mass can be described by the combination of two Gaussians (referred to as the star-forming Gaussian and the quiescent Gaussian). Using the observed bimodality to define SFG, we investigate how the fraction of SFG F(SFG) and properties of the MS change with environment. For centrals, the position of the MS is similar to the field but with a larger scatter. No significant dependence on halo mass is observed. For satellites, the position of the MS is almost always lower (by \textasciitilde{}0.2 dex) compared to the field and the width is almost always larger. F(SFG) is similar between centrals (in different halo mass bins) and field galaxies. However, for satellites F(SFG) decreases with increasing halo mass and this dependence is stronger towards lower redshift.},

  abstract = {We measure star formation rates (SFRs) of \textasciitilde{}50,000 optically selected galaxies in the local universe (z\textasciitilde{}0.1)-from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX
(ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (H$\alpha$). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H$\alpha$ measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak H$\alpha$, and where H$\alpha$ is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of
the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without H$\alpha$ emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to
quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no H$\alpha$ show signs of star formation in the UV. We
derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

(SFR-M${_\ast}$) plane is a powerful diagnostic for galaxy
evolution at different cosmic times. We consider a sample of 24 463
galaxies from the CANDELS/GOODS-S survey to conduct a detailed analysis
of the SFR-M${_\ast}$ relation at redshifts re than three dex
in stellar mass. To obtain SFR estimates, we utilise mid- and far-IR
photometry when available, and rest-UV fluxes for all the other
galaxies. We perform our analysis in different redshift bins, with two
different methods: 1) a linear regression fitting of all star-forming
galaxies, defined as those with specific SFRs log 10(sSFR/
yr-1) $>$ -9.8, similarly to what is typically done in the
literature; 2) a multi-Gaussian decomposition to identify the galaxy
main sequence (MS), the starburst sequence and the quenched galaxy
cloud. We find that the MS slope becomes flatter when higher stellar
mass cuts are adopted, and that the apparent slope change observed at
high masses depends on the SFR estimation method. In addition, the
multi-Gaussian decomposition reveals the presence of a starburst
population which increases towards low stellar masses and high
redshifts. We find that starbursts make up 5\% of all galaxies at z =
0.5-1.0, while they account for 16\% of galaxies at 2 10(M${_\ast}$/M0) = 8.25-11.25. We
conclude that the dissection of the SFR-M${_\ast}$ in multiple
components over a wide range of stellar masses is necessary to
understand the importance of the different modes of star formation
through cosmic time.},

  abstract = {Star formation rate (SFR) distributions of galaxies are often assumed to be bimodal with modes corresponding to star-forming and quiescent galaxies, respectively. Both classes of galaxies are typically studied separately, and SFR distributions of star-forming galaxies are commonly modelled as lognormals. Using both observational data and results from numerical simulations, I argue that this division into star-forming and quiescent galaxies is unnecessary from a theoretical point of view and that the SFR distributions of the whole population can be well fitted by zero-inflated negative binomial distributions. This family of
distributions has three parameters that determine the average SFR of the galaxies in the sample, the scatter relative to the star-forming sequence and the fraction of galaxies with zero SFRs, respectively. The proposed distributions naturally account for (I) the discrete nature of star formation, (II) the presence of 'dead' galaxies with zero SFRs and (III) asymmetric scatter. Excluding 'dead' galaxies, the distribution of log SFR is unimodal with a peak at the star-forming sequence and an extended tail towards low SFRs. However, uncertainties and biases in the SFR measurements can create the appearance of a bimodal distribution.},

new statistical technique to quantify the impact on the quenched

steeper than for any other variable considered. We compare to the
Illustris hydrodynamical simulation and the Munich semi-analytic model
(L-Galaxies), finding that our results for centrals are qualitatively
consistent with their predictions for quenching via radio-mode AGN
feedback, hinting at the viability of this process in explaining our
observational trends. However, we also find evidence that quenching in
L-Galaxies is too efficient and quenching in Illustris is not efficient
enough, compared to observations. For satellites, we find strong
evidence that environment affects their quenched fraction at fixed
central velocity dispersion, particularly at lower masses. At higher
masses, satellites behave identically to centrals in their quenching. Of
the environmental parameters considered, local density affects the
quenched fraction of satellites the most at fixed central velocity
dispersion.},

  abstract = {Galaxy mergers are believed to play a key role in transforming star-forming disc galaxies into quenched ellipticals. Most of our theoretical knowledge about such morphological transformations does, however, rely on idealized simulations where processes such as cooling of hot halo gas into the disc and gas accretion in the post-merger phase are not treated in a self-consistent cosmological fashion. In this paper, we study the morphological evolution of the stellar components of four major mergers occurring at z = 0.5 in cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations. In all simulations, the merger reduces the disc mass fraction, but all galaxies simulated at our highest resolution regrow a significant disc by z = 0 (with a disc fraction larger than 24 per cent). For runs with our default physics model, which includes galactic winds from star formation and black hole feedback, none of the merger remnants are quenched, but in a set of simulations with stronger black hole feedback, we find that major mergers can indeed quench galaxies. We conclude that major merger remnants commonly evolve into star-forming disc galaxies, unless sufficiently strong active galactic nucleus feedback assists in the quenching of the remnant.},

converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a
remarkable consensus among MS observations (\textasciitilde{}0.1 dex 1$\sigma$

bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS
within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter
between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS

fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our
best-fit log SFR(M *, t) = (0.84 $\pm$ 0.02 - 0.026

high density environments based on fixed cylindrical aperture
environment measurements on a volume-limited environment defining
population. For quiescent and SF galaxies in low or high density
environments, we examine the evolution of their stellar mass function
(SMF). Then using the SMFs we compute
\{\{f\}Q\}(\{\{M\}*\}) and quantify its evolution within
our redshift range. We find that the quiescent fraction is higher at
higher masses and in denser environments. The quiescent fraction rises
with cosmic time for all masses and environments. At a fiducial mass of

the quiescent fraction rises by 15\% at the lowest environments and by
25\% at the highest environments we measure. These results suggest that
for a minority of galaxies their cessation of star formation is due to
external influences on them. In other words, in the recent universe a
substantial fraction of the galaxies that cease forming stars do so due
to internal processes.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the
uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

Data are represented by a mixture model in which each component corresponds to a different cluster.

Noise and outliers can be modelled by adding a Poisson process component. Partitions are determined by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood, with initial values from agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Models are compared using an approximation to the Bayes factor based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); unlike significance tests, this allows comparison of more than two models at the same time, and removes the restriction that the models compared be nested. The problems of determining the number of clusters and the clustering method are solved simultaneously by choosing the best model. Moreover, the EM result provides a measure of uncertainty about the associated classification of each data point. Examples are given, showing that this approach can give performance that is much better than standard procedures, which often fail to identify groups that are either overlapping or of varying sizes and shapes.},

from data, can be used to classify data, which is one of the most common
tasks in observational astronomy. In this paper, we focus on Bayesian
data classification algorithms using the Gaussian mixture model and show
two applications in pulsar astronomy. After reviewing the Gaussian
mixture model and the related expectation-maximization algorithm, we
present a data classification method using the Neyman-Pearson test. To
demonstrate the method, we apply the algorithm to two classification
problems. First, it is applied to the well-known period-period
derivative diagram, where we find that the pulsar distribution can be
modelled with six Gaussian clusters, with two clusters for millisecond
pulsars (recycled pulsars) and the rest for normal pulsars. From this
distribution, we derive an empirical definition for millisecond pulsars
as \{P$\backslash$dot;\}/\{10-17\}$\leq$3.23(\{P\}/\{100ms\})-2.34.
The two millisecond pulsar clusters may have different evolutionary origins,
since the companion stars to these pulsars in the two clusters show
different chemical compositions. Four clusters are found for normal
pulsars. Possible implications for these clusters are also discussed.
Our second example is to calculate the likelihood of unidentified Fermi
point sources being pulsars and rank them accordingly. In the ranked
point-source list, the top 5 per cent sources contain 50 per cent known
pulsars, the top 50 per cent contain 99 per cent known pulsars and no
known active galaxy (the other major population) appears in the top 6
per cent. Such a ranked list can be used to help the future follow-up
observations for finding pulsars in unidentified Fermi point sources.},

how ‚Äòred' and ‚Äòblue' galaxies have been selected/defined. Accordingly,
we model our data as two naturally overlapping populations, each with
their own mass function and colour-mass relation, which enables us
characterize the two populations without having to specify a priori
which galaxies are ‚Äòred' and ‚Äòblue'. Our results then provide the means
to derive objective operational definitions for the terms ‚Äòred' and
‚Äòblue', which are based on the phenomenology of the colour-mass
diagrams. Informed by this descriptive modelling, we show that (1) after
accounting for dust, the stellar colours of ‚Äòblue' galaxies do not
depend strongly on mass; (2) the tight, flat ‚Äòdead sequence' does not
extend much below log M* \texttildelow{} 10.5; instead, (3) the
stellar colours of ‚Äòred' galaxies vary rather strongly with mass, such
that lower mass ‚Äòred' galaxies have bluer stellar populations; (4) below

  abstract = {Millimeter very long baseline interferometry (mm-VLBI) provides the 
novel capacity to probe the emission region of a handful of supermassive
black holes on sub-horizon scales. For Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the
supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, this provides
access to the region in the immediate vicinity of the horizon. Broderick
et al. have already shown that by leveraging spectral and polarization
information as well as accretion theory, it is possible to extract
accretion-model parameters (including black hole spin) from mm-VLBI
experiments containing only a handful of telescopes. Here we repeat this
analysis with the most recent mm-VLBI data, considering a class of
aligned, radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. We find
that the combined data set rules out symmetric models for Sgr A*'s flux
distribution at the 3.9$\sigma$ level, strongly favoring length-to-width
ratios of roughly 2.4:1. More importantly, we find that physically
motivated accretion flow models provide a significantly better fit to
the mm-VLBI observations than phenomenological models, at the 2.9$\sigma$
level. This implies that not only is mm-VLBI presently capable of
distinguishing between potential physical models for Sgr A*'s emission,
but further that it is sensitive to the strong gravitational lensing
associated with the propagation of photons near the black hole. Based
upon this analysis we find that the most probable magnitude, viewing
angle, and position angle for the black hole spin are a = 0.0+0.64

information theory such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and those on Bayesian inference such as the Bayesian evidence and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The Deviance Information Criterion combines ideas from both heritages; it is readily computed from Monte Carlo posterior samples and, unlike the AIC and BIC, allows for parameter degeneracy. I describe the properties of the information criteria, and as an example compute them from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 3-yr data for several cosmological models. I find that at present the information theory and Bayesian approaches give significantly different conclusions from that data.},

Also, the large-sample limits of estimators which are constrained to have a fixed finite number of components are identified as distributions minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence from the true mixing distribution. Estimation of a Poisson mixture distribution is illustrated using the distribution of traffic accidents presented by Simar.},

Third, posterior simulation does not provide a direct estimate of the posterior for the number of components. We present some practical methods for coping with these problems.

We present a function that resembles negative free energy and show that the M step maximizes this function with respect to the model parameters and the E step maximizes it with respect to the distribution over the unobserved variables. From this perspective, it is easy to justify an incremental variant of the EM algorithm in which the distribution for only one of the unobserved variables is recalculated in each E step. This variant is shown empirically to give faster convergence in a mixture estimation problem. A variant of the algorithm that exploits sparse conditional distributions is also described, and a wide range of other variant algorithms are also seen to be possible.},

  abstract = {It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for2\^bquanta,b=1,2, cdots, 7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

This algorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved or ``underlying'' distribution function common to all samples, even when the individual data points are samples from different distributions, obtained by convolving the underlying distribution with the heteroskedastic uncertainty distribution of the data point and projecting out the missing data directions. We show how this basic algorithm can be extended with conjugate priors on all of the model parameters and a ``split-and-merge'' procedure designed to avoid local maxima of the likelihood. We demonstrate the full method by applying it to the problem of inferring the three-dimensional velocity distribution of stars near the Sun from noisy two-dimensional, transverse velocity measurements from the Hipparcos satellite.},

  abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the ‚Äòtree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high
flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

  volume = {1807},
  abstract = {We study the chaotic-like behavior of cosmological simulations by 
quantifying how minute perturbations grow over time and manifest as
macroscopic differences in galaxy properties. When we run the same setup
multiple times, the results produced by our code, Arepo, are binary
identical. However, when we run pairs of 'shadow' simulations that are
identical except for random minute initial displacements to particle
positions (e.g. of order 10\^-7pc), the results diverge from each other
at the individual galaxy level (while the statistical properties of the
ensemble of galaxies are unchanged). After cosmological times, the
global properties of pairs of 'shadow' galaxies that are matched between
the simulations differ from each other generally at a level of \textasciitilde{}2-25\%,
depending on the considered physical quantity. We perform these
experiments using cosmological volumes of (25-50Mpc/h)\^3 evolved either
purely with dark matter, or with baryons and star-formation but no
feedback, or using the full feedback model of the IllustrisTNG project.
The runs cover four resolution levels spanning a factor of 512 in mass.
We find that without feedback the differences between shadow galaxies
generally become smaller as the resolution increases, but with the
IllustrisTNG model the results are mostly converging towards a 'floor'.
This hints at the role of feedback in setting the chaotic properties of
galaxy formation. Importantly, we compare the macroscopic differences
between shadow galaxies to the overall scatter in various galaxy scaling
relations, and conclude that for the star formation-mass and the
Tully-Fisher relations the chaotic behavior of our simulations
contributes significantly to the overall scatter. We discuss the
implications for galaxy formation theory in general and for cosmological
simulations in particular.},

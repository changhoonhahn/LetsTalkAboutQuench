## Response to Referee

#### Reviewer's Comments:
The paper 'IQ-Collaboratory 1.1: the Star-Forming Sequence of Simulated Central
Galaxies' by Hahn et al. compares the star-forming sequence (SFS) between
various simulations and SDSS. The key aspect of the comparison is the usage of
Gaussian Mixture Models to identify the SFS. The paper is written well, and the
results are definitely interesting and important for the community. I therefore
recommend this paper after some moderate revision (see below).

In order to test the impact of mass resolution, we use a higher mass 
resolution EAGLE simulation and compare the identified SFSs. We find 
that the SFS is underestimated near the mass resolution limit
for lower resolution boxes. However, this is not a significant effect
and impacts the SFS by less than 0.2 dex. Although higher resolution 
Illustris simulations are not available, we use lower resolution 
Illustris simulations to conduct the same comparison and find consistent
results. Therefore, the impact of mass resolution on the stellar masses 
of hydro simulations does not significantly impact the identified SFSs,
especially above the stellar mass limits of our analysis. We discuss 
this comparison in Appendix C.

We choose 0.5 dex in order to relax any assumptions on the slope
of the SFS and also avoid misclassifying the quiescent population 
as SFS at the high mass end. The SFS identification, however, is 
not significantly impacted by the difference between the mean values
within the range 0.2 - 0.8 dex. We include this discussion in Section 3.

Our method of identifying the SFS and other components using GMMs, 
does not assume that the population as a whole is Gaussian. With GMMs, 
we determine the combination of Gaussians that best reproduce the
distribution of the population without any assumptions on the shape
of the distribution. As a result, any significant non-Gaussianities 
in the distribution would result in a GMM with extra components that
better match the non-Gaussianities in the distribution. This is the
case, for instance, in the SC-SAM logM_*=9.2-9.4 bins of Figures B.1. 
and B.2. (bottom left) where the best-fit GMM consists of two 
star-forming components rather than one. Although the components of 
the GMM are assumed to be Gaussians, from the data alone, it is 
impossible to determine whether the "true" distribution consists of 
two separate Gaussian sub-populations or a single non-Gaussian one. 
In principle we can use mixture models with non-Gaussian components,
but it will require assuming some other shape.

Similarly, the "true" sub-populations are not well defined from 
the data. We therefore avoid classifying the GMM components as 
star-forming, quiescent, transitioning, or star-burst populations 
from the literature and use more empirical definitions (e.g. low, 
med, and high-SF) populations. We clarify these points in Section 4.2. 
and Appendix B.

In Section 2. we describe how we derive stellar masses for the 
simulation in further detail and underline the caveats of comparing 
the stellar masses of simulation to observations. We also include 
that using total stellar masses within the halo or stellar masses 
within 70, 50, 30 kpc, does not impact the idenfified SFSs for the 
EAGLE simulation. We also mention that this effect will be explicitly 
addressed in the next paper of the series: Starkenburg et al. (in prep).

A higher redshift (0.5 < z < 3) SFS comparison is currently in preparation as 
part of the IQ-Collaboratory series (Choi et al. in prep.) We mention this 
more clearly in Section 1.

In Section 4.1., in addition to the SFS, we compare the cosmic
star formation densities and stellar mass functions and find significant 
discrepancies in both. As a result we discussion in Section 4.1. that the 
difference in SFS among the simulation is likely caused by differences in both 
properties as predicted by the different sub-grid prescriptions.

We have added a panel to Fig. A1 with the SFS from the simulations with 
SSFR no cut. We discuss in Appendix A. the consistency of the SFS slopes 
in the middle panel and emphasize that imposing a hard $\log\,\mathrm{SSFR}$ 
cut forces consistency in the slopes and underline how this is another 
drawback of hard cuts.

We test the impact of M* and SFR with radial cuts of (70, 50, 30 kpc) using
the EAGLE simulation and find no significantly impact on the SFS identified.
We include this in Section 2 and in our discussion in Section 4.1.

We have include extra background information on the BIC and
discuss its advantages for model selection. We also discuss in
Appendix B how Figures B.1. and B.2. illustrate how among GMMs
with similar BICs the k values does not significantly impact
the position and variance of the SFS component.

We have added the following sentences in Section 4.2.:
Additionally, Genel et al. (2018) recently showed that chaotic effects can 
contribute to the overall scatter in the SFS. However, since we derive 
$\sigma_\mathrm{SFS}$ from a large galaxy population this butterfly effect 
does not impact the measurement reliability of statistical properties of the 
ensemble of galaxies because the sensitivity of individual galaxy SFRs averages 
out. However, the different degree of the butterfly effect on different 
simulations may contribute the difference in $\sigma_\mathrm{SFS}$  among 
the simulations.

We have included observational errors estimated for the SFRs
of the NYU-VAGC (~0.031 dex) and also specific quote the
contribution to the scatter from burstiness listed in
Sparre et al. (2017): 0.10 - 0.17 dex.

We have added in Section 2 that all gas gravitationally bound 
to the subhalo are included in the instantaneous SFR.

We included a table summarizing the key parameters of the simulations
(mass resolution, volume, softening lengths) and properties that we cite
in the paper: (completeness of group finder, cosmic SFR density, etc.)

See response to earlier comment above.

We estimate the quiescent fraction using all components below 
the SFS and galaxies with unmeasurably low SFRs (green, orange, 
and red). With the intermediate component (green) included in the
quiescent fraction, we find little stellar mass dependence. We
clarify our quiescent fraction definition in the third bullet 
point.
